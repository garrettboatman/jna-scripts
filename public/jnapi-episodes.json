Do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? Should we not even bother? Should we be like, You know what? I'm gonna drive my car and I'm gonna eat my gasoline and I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm an american?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Incoherent fast talking<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I can't. I can't...let's do that again. I can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. So just talk normal.<br />\n<br />\nJake: More fast talking<br />\n<br />\nAmir: laughs You did it again. You talked..you talked like super fast, and I can't..nobody's gonna understand you.<br />\n<br />\nJake: More fast talking<br />\n<br />\nAmir: laughs All right, let's just...stop it. Let's just do it later, 'cause I'm..I'm running late, so I have to go anyway. (Amir turns to leave, but as he starts walking, time slows down tremendously.

That's just a common misconception. And personally? I think we should just..let loose, you know? Drive our cars into the ozone layer. Eat garbage. Poop anywhere we want, like...the earth is fucked, and we're all going to be dead by the time global warming really takes effect, so, what's the point, right?<br />\n<br />\nSecond response: I..I was talking pretty normally. I didn't...really don't think I did anything..like fast forwarding? That's..what the hell does that even mean?<br />\n<br />\nThird response: That's absurd. Not true at all. I don't..I'm talking [at a] very normal speed right now.<br />\n",

Follow my lead, and never don't follow my lead.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(Dan, Jake, and Amir are sitting at table)<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Cool, Caveman Frat Party. Uh, honestly, right off the bat, I like it, it's good.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Honestly, right off the bat, no shit.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Uh... Ok.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Bottom of page one, the main character sees a McDonald's burning down in the distance and he starts to cry, and I don't get that, so I was wondering what's-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Wow- whoa-like- what- It's the saddest thing somebody can see, so I think, like, when you cry, it's not-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's- it's- you can- It's cuttable, right? You can cut that.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Cuttable, so yeah, I'll- I'll cut that, then.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Well... Ahh, Ok. Uh, that's fine. It happens again.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Yeah, it happens on every page, so I'll just-<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Oh, yeah, you numbered the pages wrong, which is borderline impressive 'cause it's automated software.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, I don't use software. I just (farting noise with mouth) write all- I do the-<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: So, this section (simultaneously) I felt the dialogue could be almost half the length because you can get what you're trying to say just quicker, snappier.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (simultaneously) Yeah, yes, yes, yes, very. Aw, half the length, and then you can get it to change, just get it across and then-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What's he talking about?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: This script.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: More specifically.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Oh, here's a thing. Uh, audience lolz go here. Guys, let's not tell the audience when to laugh, let's just write funny stuff and trust it.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Def.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: More specifically? I don't know, he's saying that everything is long. But, that's good, and it should be longer. As lo- er- as lo- the longer the better.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's the opposite of what he just said.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Page 19.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's the exact opposite of what he said.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So why are all good movies three hours plus, right? What, does that make sense?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: There's a lot of good, short movies.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Alright, cool, come on.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Scene directions. So here it says this shit is crazy insane.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (interrupting , high voice) This shit is crazy insane-o. <br />\n<br />\nDAN: Right.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: High pitched voice, right?<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Yeah, I see that you wrote that, but what does that mean? That doesn't even...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: He drew a picture of a fireball.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Fireball, right there.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Right, and Jake, that's the thing to generally not do.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Well, yeah, I couldn't- I (simultaneously) couldn't agree more.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: couldn't agree less... with that.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. All the character names are Jake.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: You can't name the characters Jake-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Because people need to know-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: We don't want to spoon-feed our audience.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: I don't know if I want to do this anymore.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I know.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: As a job.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh, as a job.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Will Ferrell, I doubt-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (deep voice) Frank the Tank!<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Is not gonna be in it because he's Will Ferrell.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, well, the way I cast my characters is I- I- I aim for the moon and then I shoot myself.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: You just said you're gonna shoot yourself.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (scoffs) You're gonna let him talk to me like that.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yep.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ahh.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: So a couple more things.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Alright, you know what, you haven't stopped bitching about this script since you got here.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: I'm trying to give you constructive criticism.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Hah, yeah. More like destructive cynicism.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How did you learn those words?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDAN: Cool, so you know what? We got a good first line, we got a good last line, I'll just take it from there.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Just have one more crack at rewriting it.<br />\n<br />\nDAN: No.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Just give us one more-<br />\n<br />\nDAN: (simultaneously) No, don't worry guys.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (simultaneously) It's fine, we can do this. We're a dynamic team!<br />\n<br />\nDAN: You know what, no, because you know what, you don't even deserve an excuse, I'm just gonna write it, 'cause it's really bad!<br />\n<br />\n(Dan walks out)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok? Wow. What- what crawled into his butt? Jake. (high voice) Vhat crawled into his butthole? Hm. Jake. Give me his SMS code right now, I'm gonna text him that question.

Jeez louises, enjoy! All right?

Why are you on my computer in the first place? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I already told you, I have a gay-ass Dell desktop computer and my dad won't buy me a new one because I DIED! Argh! Is that a MacBook or a MacBook Pro? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How about you just leave? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Something tells me you won't be very pissed when you check your Facebook status update. I changed it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Really? Why don't you just get me a towel?! Right now!<br />\n<br />\n AMIR: Did you check yet? It's fly as shit.<br />\n<br />\n JAKE: No, I haven't and I don't want you going on my Facebook any-- <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It says, \"I'm at the gym, hooking up with a hottie. Hit up the cell.\"<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Awesome.<br />\n<br />\n AMIR: So...(laughs) <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (takes towel) Thank you. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh, but I said it 'cellie',  which is like a new, cool way of saying it. Remember I told you to say it like that last week. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why are you still here?! <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I told you, I choked on a golfball 12 years ago, and I can't leave! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No, I mean, why are you still in my room?<br />\n<br />\n AMIR: OK, I guess I think I know when I'm not wanted. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Don't just turn invisible, I know you're still here. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh! Let me make you one of my patented smoothies! They are re-donkey-lips. (goes to kitchen) <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Did you download Kazaa? ...I thought this was dead, like you. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (making the smoothie) Is this too loud?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yes. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh my ghost! (sniffs) Ah, this is insane. Come here and smell it, unless you can smell it from over there. Can you smell it from there, is that why you're not coming here?  OK, give me a dollar to drink this? I'm just going to do it and you're going to owe me a buck. You're fine with straight owing me cash? ...OK, I did it. (pours it on floor) OK, so dollar right there and uh, I'll just take it from the twenty that I borrowed from you earlier. Remember?

Do you want to come over or something?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Do you seriously not remember? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: We got drunk last night!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Uh, yeah, I don't- I honestly don't remember. Did we? Oh.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Oh, my god. It's called blacking out, man.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You must've forgotten the entire night! <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah! I think so. This is awesome! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (chuckling) Shit! I had no idea you could drink that much. Did you know you could drink that much?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, definitely. Why? How much though?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Try three bottles of vodka!  <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah! I knew that! I could drink more than that. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I know you can because you had some fucking gin right afterwards!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh yeah, we had the gymnastics.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah, they called you the gin guzzler, yo. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, they call me the gym guzzler, yo. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: The gin guzzler. You were dancing. You were out on the dance floor. You were all being fucking weird. You were shaking your shit around.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir is shaking about) <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah, everyone thought you looked like an asshole! <br />\n<br />\n(Amir abruptly stops)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK.

She walks on over and she's all swaggin' it and you got your confidence all turned on--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (swaying) Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --and you grab her by the waist and--<br />\n<br />\n(Amir tries to grab Jake by the waist)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Her by the waist!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Sure. (faces wall as if that's the girl)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: All right, not me. And you were like 'Hey, babe.' you kissed her right on the mouth. <br />\n<br />\n(Amir acts as though he's going to make out with the wall)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's what I'm talking about. And then she fucking PUKED!<br />\n<br />\n(Amir acts as though he's been puked on)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ugh!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: All over you, it was crazy! How do you not remember this? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I do, uh, yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You were fucking cussing her out. You were all pissed about it--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Stupid B. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --bouncer, he comes over and he's like 'Hey, you yelling at this girl?'--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (motioning as if there's a bouncer there) No! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --and then her boyfriend came over--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (now motioning to an invisible boyfriend) Hey, man! No, no, no.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Then, he flails you up against the wall--<br />\n<br />\n(Amir throws himself against the wall)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --and he's like 'I'm going to kick your ass' and you're fucking pleading with your eyes--<br />\n<br />\n(Amir is making a puppy face)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --please don't take my life, please don't take my life. You're begging him with your eyes and he- You're freakin' peeing your pants. You're pissing your pants. He felt bad for you and he just tossed you out on the curb.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir throws himself onto the floor) <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You crawled back in and you were like 'Aw, fuck, please Jake, I need to get home--<br />\n<br />\n(Amir is miming along with Jake from the floor)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --let me borrow ten bucks to get home. Please, please, please.' Then I lent you ten bucks and I want that back now and I won't tell anybody about what happened last night. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, I only have a twenty. But why don't you take it, and you don't tell anybody about last night, twice. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Deal. (turns and walks down hallway) Hey, Rosie, movie is on me! (stops after a few steps and sighs) I feel bad. (turns and walks back to Amir) Let me get another twenty, I don't want to make him walk. We're going to take a cab. We're going to cab it. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You're going to cab it. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (taking the money forcefully from Amir's hand) We're going to cab it. <br />\n<br />\nTHE END. <br />\n<br />\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ivBBLxesJY<br />\n",

You stole it from me.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Sure, stole it and sold it brotha, I mean it's highway robbery, you know? What are we even arguing about anymore?

I don't-I don't get what you're trying to do. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Basically, I thought I'd come in here, everybody would start losing their sheesh once they realized it's my halfie, and then instead of quelling them down 'cause everyone is so loud and stuff, I'd just remove my shirt and the message is displayed. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's not even polite. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Well, I know.

But everything was all backwards so it was difficult to read. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I mean, there's a f***ing arrow.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I know,  I thought it was a letter.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Then you didn't know. You either knew, or you thought it was a letter. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Then I thought it was a letter. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm going to f***ing kill Leron if there's an arrow on my back, I swear. <br />\n<br />\nTHE END. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOUTRO<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: He's done, simple as that.

I thought you multiply them together or something.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Would still be wrong.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [annoyed] Ah!<br />\n<br />\nJake: What?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Still be right.

[flips the top card in the deck over]<br />\n<br />\nAmir is now holding the deck of cards in his hand.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alright, maybe we should learn how to count cards. [flips a card] One, [flips another card] two, [flips another card] Aahh! Um, okay, let's go back to basic strategy.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's a basic strategy. [Takes deck of cards from Amir]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah. <br />\n<br />\nAmir has the deck of cards. Jake is looking away from him with his arms on the table. He is exhausted and pissed off. Amir pulls a card from the deck and holds it up to Jake.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Was this your card?<br />\n<br />\nJake: They're all my cards. You made me pick every card.

Jake is looking away again. The deck of cards has been abandoned on the table.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You know I don't have to teach you anymore if you don't want.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Okay, okay, just give me just five more minutes! T-bag.<br />\n<br />\nAmir jumps onto Jakes bed while Jake looks at him surprised.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You know what? Let's play this instead. [Hold up deck] If it's red, say fire.

I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever. Oh sheesh y'all.<br />\n",

Easy money.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n[Jake and Amir sitting at their desks]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Whoa, Jake, I just realized something big. The sky is blue because of.. the scattering like, sunlight fragmi--mints, and then, a prism, and, your human eyes.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That was smart. Even though you kinda went off into sentence fragments at the end there and made no coherent point, I think you're smart because you used big words. And then when you finished, you raised your eyebrows at me, which really solidified the point that you knew exactly what you were talking about.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, o- I mean on a sunny day, reighley scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, dark in the zenith and light near the.. horizon!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Wow. It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Absolowly.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You mean absolutely.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (stumbling as he makes up a definition) No, uh, I mean absolowly, which is.. Franish for.. absolutely.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. (Amir makes a variety of strange faces). Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (rapping) Yo yo SO, son, I wanna jump around and make ya go.... AAAH! (Amir's aaah noise)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That was a tight rap. (Amir continues making strange faces.) Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir pumps his arms up and down with his palms upward.)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.<br />\n<br />\n(Amiir squints and nods.)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir smiles.)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (childishly impatient and exasperated) Are we gonna go the the Dees or not?!<br />\n<br />\nEND.<br />\n",

Amir has a sling on his right arm and 2 black eyes. He isn't wearing his glasses.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: So the nurse is like [closes nose] Sorry sir, we can't stay the night with you, even if you are afraid of the dark, [releases nose] and I'm like Bitch, you ain't going anywhere, there might be ghosts up in here so I grab her [grabs Jake's polo shirt] like-<br />\n<br />\nJake: Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to tell me anything you might be embarrassed about.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm not embarrassed about anything! So I grab her right [grabs Jake again] and she finally wrestles loose and she goes to call, I don't know, her supervisor or whatever [begins to rustle through Sarah's bag] but it's complete darkness in there so I start freaking out.<br />\n<br />\nJake sees Amir going through Sarah's bag<br />\n<br />\nJake: [Whispers angrily] Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.<br />\n<br />\nPan over to Sarah who is sitting at her desk wearing headphones and facing her computer. Pan back to Amir who continues going through the bag.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [chuckles] What do I care? So you know it's complete darkness in there, I'm crying but it's starting to burn because [in a weird voice] my eyes are broken or whatever-<br />\n<br />\nJake: Stay out of Sarah's bag<br />\n<br />\nAt this moment Amir pulls a pink tampon out of Sarah's bag. He puts his hands up as if he were surrendering without noticing the tampon in his hand.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: OK, relax. [looks at tampon] Oh...<br />\n<br />\nJake closes his eyes then massages his forehead.<br />\n<br />\nJake: [Looks away] Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.<br />\n<br />\nAmir unwraps the tampon and smells it.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Amir don't. [Massages forehead again] Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?<br />\n<br />\nAt this point Amir holds the tampon is his mouth. He is moving it around inside his mouth while moaning.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh, oh, ahaha!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Sarah! Hey, Sarah.<br />\n<br />\nThe camera pans to Sarah again who turns around and sees Amir with the tampon in his mouth. <br />\n<br />\nAmir is now making gargling noises. <br />\n<br />\nAmir appears to be stuffing the tampon down his throat. <br />\n<br />\nThe camera cuts to Jake with a confused look on his face.<br />\n<br />\nThe camera cuts back to Amir who has closed his mouth on the tampon. The string at the end sticks out of his mouth.<br />\n<br />\nThe camera cuts to Sarah who looks at Amir with disgust.<br />\n<br />\nThe camera cuts back to Amir. (It is implied that) the tampon is completely inside his mouth now. He swallows. His face which was smiling before, now looks concerned and scared.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Wow, are you ok?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [speaks in wheezes] I'm fine.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Good, so you're not choking or anything?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [speaks in wheezes] Choking? Haha, don't make me laugh. [Laughs]<br />\n<br />\nJake: [in unison with Amir's laugh, but with concern] Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [still wheezing] Heimlich, what are you crazy? I'm gonna go get lunch [Jake nods], um, do you want anything?<br />\n<br />\nJake: [Shakes his head] Nope. I don't.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [wheezing] I'm going to peace on outta here [makes peace sign with his hands]<br />\n<br />\nJake: Alright, peace out.<br />\n<br />\nAmir begins to wheel himself away, pushing Jake's chair in the process. Amir seems to be calm while Jake is still freaking out.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: But, oh, by the way, before I forget, [takes deep breath in] what's the name of that song that goes [starts dancing in his chair. Jake does the same, calmer now] Come my lady/come come my lady/you're my butterfly.<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time:<br />\nJake: Sugar-<br />\nAmir: [grabs Jake's shirt] I'M GONNA DIE!<br />\n<br />\nJake quickly gets up while Amir wheezes and struggles to breathe. Jake goes around Amir and begins doing the modified Heimlich maneuver because Amir is in a wheelchair.<br />\n<br />\nCut to Sarah who looks extra concerned.<br />\n<br />\nCut back to Jake and Amir. Jake continues to do the Heimlich maneuver until the tampon falls out of Amir's mouth. Amir begins to struggle and cough. The tampon falls to the floor. Amir begins to breathe forcefully, still a little wheezing.<br />\n<br />\nCut back to Sarah, who is still concerned.<br />\n<br />\nJake: [relieved] God, that was close.<br />\n<br />\nJake pats Amir on the back and ANOTHER tampon falls out of his mouth, then onto the floor. Jake and Sarah exchange confused looks.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: By the way it's Sugar Ray's Butterfly is the song.<br />\n<br />\nJake: [shakes his head] That's not true.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yea, I know it's not.<br />\n",

Which is sad for me to have to say because it sounds like we're going out or something. We need space. <br />\n<br />\nRICKY: So Motorola is flying Amir to the big football game in Miami, and I told him he could bring somebody; he chose you. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE:  (taking a seat by Ricky) I . . .

We'll- I'll go to the game, so. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I thought you said you didn't want to spend any time with me inside the office. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Inside the office.   <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Or outside of it. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah!  Oh my god! You guys thought I was serious?  You are the weakest links, goodbye. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So you do want to come to Miami with me? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah. Yeah I do. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And you do want to see across from me at work? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah . . . yeah, buddy. God, I'd love to sit across fr-- you know what? You know what the problem is? Murph, the guy across from me now, total buzz kill, he doesn't want to switch. It's ridiculous! But when is our flight though? To Miami?<br />\n<br />\nRICKY: Jake, if Amir wants to take you to Miami, you'll go--<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (grabbing for Ricky's arm) Don't make me twist your arm!<br />\n<br />\nRICKY: OW! Oh my god! I just had surgery on this shoulder this morning!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: This morning?! God, I had no-- wow, I really had no idea.

Get away from me. I can't have lunch with you. But I'll meet you at the airport! The Miami airport.

All I'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! That's it! It's a time saver!<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's it? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: That's it, yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's really unsanitary.

Didn't you say it's also her birthday? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: It is also her birthday, yes. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Okay... <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Two Hallmark holidays for the price of one. Free!

It proves my point.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I hate when you're accidentally right. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Basically there was an accident and there is a well pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean every single day.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: What's the big deal, just stuff it with garbage, that's what I would do.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Wow they actually thought of that and it's insanely disappointing that you're coming up with the same solutions as they are.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah... disappointing for me? Err...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: For the world.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: For the wolf.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: For the world.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I think the scariest thing isn't the rate at which the oil is spilling but rather spiders! Okay those things are freaky for real.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: \"Yeah\" you agree or \"Yeah\" you're just getting me to shut up?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: If you could change one thing about the oil spill what would it be...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: The rig would never explode<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: ...and why? Hmm, little harder than you thought.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Soil, foil, Susan Boyle.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Can you go back to your desk?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Noil<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Drill baby drill huh, more like kill baby krill.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's actually kind of clever.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: If only krill was a word.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Okay never mind.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah forget it. Forget it, it's got it, it's gone.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yup.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: There's this episode of Saved by the Bell where uh...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: With the oil spill?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No the one where Zach impersonates a Russian chess player from Valley and let's Screech beat him.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why would you bring that up now?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Cuz it's funny!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: As sad as this whole oil spill thing is, it might be like the one catalyst that sort of springs us and the world in general to sort of think about alternative energy sources going forward.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You might be right, you might be right.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah... I'm just KIDDING you idiot! Haha you Carfucker I got you! Yeah how about an automobile that runs on ocean water so that when the ocean water spills into the ocean nobody gives a crap? How about...<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You know this whole thing wouldn't be an issue if oil was more dense than water, like I suggested!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ah no no no kay kay kay, here we go. How about an automobile that's run on stupid ideas so we can just hook a pump to your ass and you can fart out these shitty ill-conceived notions for the rest of time and we can just power every car in America for the next thirty years. How 'bout that! Or, what about, thinking solar for once.<br />\n<br />\nEPISODE LINK<br />\n",

I'll go to a Yankee game anytime.

I guess no one wants to see the Reds play.  <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why not, dude? It's inter-league play, at Yankee Stadium, it's pretty cool.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (laughs) Not quite at Yankee Stadium, the game is in Cincinnati. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: All right, pull over.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Da-nati. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Pull over, man.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: The nati, shasta macnati.

I don't want to go to Cincinnati. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: We're almost there, relax! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: We are not almost there, we just left, OK? And the game is in two hours, we're going to miss it.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: We're not - (sighs). The game is not in two hours, check the date, it's in 26 hours, idiot. OK, so we're barely going to miss it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: But we're still missing the game. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, a little bit, but what's the big deal when you got (high pitched) the Overbeck Pottery Museum! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Doesn't sound like it's in Cincinnati, it sounds like it's in Overbeck. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, well you're wrong, again, because it's not in either; it's in Cambridge City, Indiana, which sounds far away but it's actually only a six hour drive from Cincinnati, which means road trip #2!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, well I don't want to go on road trip number one, so just please pull over. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: That's fine. You're just being a little bit of a buzz kill right now but what you need is a high level of the tickle monster! (lets go of wheel to try and tickle Jake)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, pull--Watch the road! Watch the road!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (grabs wheel again) Oh my god! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE:  Geez! You're going to kill both of us.  You're going to kill us.  Let me drive. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: N-n-n-n-no. I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to get me to let go of the steering wheel. It's not  gonna happen, OK? I don't trust you. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (sighs) I know a short cut. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Do you? OK, let's stop right here then. <br />\n<br />\n(they pull into a parking lot and Amir gets out to walk around the van while Jake slides over inside)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (while walking around to other side) But I hope you realize that this move, this little switch, makes me the DJ of this party-mobile. That's right, all party tunes, all the time. Me and you, haha, OK, uh...<br />\n<br />\n(Jake pulls away while Amir is trying at the locked passenger door) <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (on cell leaving voicemail) J.K., it's me, uh, (chuckles) you're an idiot. Look to your right, man.  You are going to realize that I am not there.

I'm good.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Well you were on the toilet, and you were sleeping, so.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So yeah, I can see why you'd think that, based on all this (gesturing around).<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why is the door open?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Door is open because I um...

Alright FINE I was asleep, ok you caught me!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah I know you were asleep, but thank you for being honest on your second try; doesn't explain the door.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Jake, ok, I'm sorry, it's too early for this.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's four in the afternoon.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes, well the door is open because I fell asleep before I got a chance to close it, ok?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ok, yeah, closing it should be the first thing you do, though.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, it was going to be, but I (makes a snoring noise) zonked out.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ya zonked out, well you had time to take your pants off, so I know you're lying.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (smiling) Ya caught me again.

It's just, Ricky said that he didn't think it was such a good idea, and then you winked at him (Amir winks), and you said (in a silly voice) trust me, when I get back with these treats, it's gonna be a good idea, (Amir mouths the words along with Jake) and then he said Trust me, it's not, and then you said I will be back in thirty seconds, forty-five tops (Amir mouths the words), the treats are on my desk, I just forgot to bring them to the meeting. And that was forty-five minutes ago.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes, that's because it's better to ask for forgiveness, than for permission.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Well you already asked for permission and he said no, so now you have to ask for both.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok. Just wipe me and we can go, please.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Sure, do you want me to wet the toilet paper?--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes, please wet the toilet paper--<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Are you f***ing crazy, you think I'm gonna wipe you?<br />\n<br />\nEND.<br />\n",

I will. Okay, so basically, it's simple. The first step is—<br />\n<br />\nJake: Amir, Amir, I know it's simple. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do it. [Jake smooches.]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Right. I guess so. Uh, you don't know how to do it, though, so...<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why don't you teach me how to do it; then I'll show you how well I can do it, a LOT weller than you could ever do it.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Weller.

Why don't you not tell me WHAT to do, but tell me HOW to do it? How! Now!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Okay (said as Oh-kay)... uh, yeah.

And then, I was like, Oh, there's a lot more important things to worry about, like getting laid! So I became the master of that.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: ...Right. So this one's called Right Inverted, Down Inverted, Right, Down.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I'm gonna beat you right down, if you don't slow down, right now, okay?

Did you get the letter I sent you, babe?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I didn't. Did you send me a letter?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I did. I did send you a letter, and let me know when you get it because there's a couple things that I want to clarify.  Firstly, in the opening paragraph--<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I said I didn't get the letter.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, just let me know when you do because I left some things intentionally ambiguous. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why would you intentionally leave things ambiguous?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So that I could clarify them later. Oooh!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, well I'll let you know.  <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Please do. Please do-do. (chuckles) Please do-do, but not in my tea, or in my coffee! Haha, no. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Where'd you send it? Where'd you send the letter? What name and address did you put on it?  Cool, so I'm not going to get the letter. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh. You'll get the letter.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'm not going to get the letter, not if you didn't put a name and address on the envelope. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, I don't want to argue with you anymore about this stupid letter!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, you shouldn't.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, you're going to get it, and we're going to laugh. And we're going to laugh and we're going to crack up when you read it. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Even if I did get the letter--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Which you will.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: --I don't think I'd laugh about it. I definitely wouldn't crack up. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, forget it. I'm going to change the subject. (pause) What do you think is in the letter?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How is that changing the subject?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (rapidly) Because before we were talking about whether or not you would get it and now we're talking about the contents of the letter. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Still sounds like we're talking about the letter. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, well I'm not going to not talk about the letter, I want to talk about the letter!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, you know what? I got the letter.  I got the letter and it's at home and I'll read it and we'll talk about it tomorrow. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You didn't get the letter.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How do you know that?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Because I never sent a letter!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Oh my god!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You placate me too often.

Some of these things are like offensive and others are just annoying.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Give me one example of each.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Here's an example of both. 'Hey did you get my poke? Poke me back if you got it, playa. Hey, my last poke said poke me back if you got it, playa. But, everybody has poke so I'm expecting one unless you're a faggot.'<br />\n<br />\nAmir shrugs. <br />\n<br />\nJake: What is that?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: A poke, it's like 'Hey, I got your attention but I don't have to write on your wall about it, just a way of saying...'<br />\n<br />\nJake: Delete your Facebook.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (clicks) Done.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You didn't do anything.

Yeah, he lost two of his front teeth. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Okay, I apologized for that.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You said: 'Sorry you don't have a sense of humor, bitch.' <br />\n<br />\nAmir: And I genuinely meant that.

She starts giggling, there's a chemistry there, <br />\nso I smile at her, but I grab her forearm and I go, Hey, that wasn't a joke. I want one of everything, bitch. She takes me at face <br />\nvalue because, you know, duality of man or whatever. Bitch starts bringing out plate by plate for like an hour and a half! We're going <br />\nnuts! The whole restaurant's just up in arms. They start adding tables, because I'm at table for one, right, so there's not enough <br />\nroom, there's not enough area to support all these plates. After every plate she's like, Are you sure you can afford all this stuff? <br />\nBecause, you know, you've seen me on Saturday nights, I'm dressed like a vagrant or whatever. But I go, Hey, not only am I sure I'm <br />\ngonna pay you for all this stuff, but there's a tip in it for you. I start losing it, I am going nuts, this is crazy right? At 11:30 I <br />\nsay eff it, I'm liveblogging the thing. It's going crazy, the Twitter sphere is just abuzz with this stuff. We're getting retweets, <br />\ncomments on my message board, it's absolutely ridonculous. We're going crazy in there! All of a sudden I start feeling like I'm in a <br />\nfucking gameshow or something—<br />\n<br />\nJake: What gameshow?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alright, long story shirt, I'll give you a blintz for 11 bucks instead of 12 if you promise to throw in a little extra for the <br />\nhuevos rancheros.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why would I pay you for your huevos rancheros?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alright lemme level with you man, because you're obviously not getting it. I can't afford to eat 500 dollars every time I go out. <br />\nI can't have that on my conscience, I can't have that on my card. So, this is what I'm gonna say to you: I finish all this food in <br />\nthree minutes or less, you pay me for it. If I don't? Okay, I'll pay you double of what I paid.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Fine.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alright, fine. (Takes a bite of the omelette) Ugh! I'm sorry, no.

Man, you're really bad at it and I would quit entirely. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ouch. (chuckles) That is a tough pill to swallow. Heh, you got to understand that I was really jazzed about these ideas last night. I was like air-boxing with no one, writing them down, getting super jazzed. So for me to hear that, that's tough man. That's tough for me to hear. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (sigh) I guarantee that if you knew what you were saying to me, if you knew how much that would affect me, that you wouldn't have said half the stuff you just said. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I think I'm going to go. (gets up and leaves shot)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, I think I'm going to peace out too. I might take a personal day because I feel like there's a--<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Well you just got back from a two and a half week long Mexican vacation. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: STAYCATION! And--(falls back into couch) You're right. Why'd you say that stuff, man? <br />\n<br />\nTHE END.<br />\n<br />\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dv43UUPJ4s<br />\n",

(to Jake) Hey, what's up?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Were you waiting for me by the elevator?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No!

I'm actually pumped to work with you today. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: On what?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Just being at work is a thrill. Why do you have to question on what?<br />\n<br />\nThey stop walking.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What is that?<br />\n<br />\nJake's desk is wrapped in toilet paper.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh! Cowards!

Did you do this?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (talking fast) No, I couldn't have done this, because earlier this morning I went pet shopping with my friend Raymond from earlier, and then we both got a hamster and went to my apartment and then we got to work at the same time. My hamster's name is... (looks at the desk) Toilet Paper, and toilet paper...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I didn't ask you the hamster's name, and wow, you should have thought of a name that didn't sound like toilet paper.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Alright, let's just blow today. Can't we just take a personal day and go for a picnic or something? I'm sure the bandit left us some sandwiches and a frisbee. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: He didn't.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Check under your desk maybe it's there.<br />\n<br />\nJake checks under the desk.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Nothing.<br />\n<br />\nAmir checks under the desk.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: What!? No! How..? Who... who did... THIS (pointing at the desk)... it's what I'm pissed about.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: The toilet paper?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah. Well, you know what? The bandit must have left the food and the frisbee at my apartment earlier today because he was distracted, busy with the scheming of things, so why don't we swing by my apartment and then the bandit might have to take a dump real quick.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: The bandit or you?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (sighs) Alright, just cut me some slack man, at least I'm trying.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You're lying.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm lying because you don't trust me ever. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How can I trust you?

The truth is I just wanted to hang out with you, okay? I'm sorry, I wanted to go on a picnic with you. But then... this bandit! (grabs toilet paper) With this joke, this prank just ruined everything!

I'm better than fine, actually. I'm great. Hey, uh, could you do me a flavor? (laughs) No, I said flavor instead of favor but could you go into my drawer and pull out one of the pieces of paper that's there? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Wow, these are a lot of reckless driving tickets. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, could you go like five minutes without editorializing? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Sorry, but I'm just saying--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm serious, I was talking to Sarah and like we both agree that you never say anything plainly. You always have to like, have the last word and it just, it gets really tiring. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, I'm going to hang up. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: W-w-wait! Could you find one that says 'oh, good driving sir. We owe you eleven hundred dollars'? And please do it without adding your two cents for once. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, there's one that says you owe them eleven hundred dollars. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No, that's not it. Keep looking. Keep looking for the one where it says they owe me the cash. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Just...before I keep looking, police don't do that.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You sure about that? Like is that a fact or is this another case of the Jake's, where you just keep on talking to hear the sound of your own voice because honestly, if it's the latter--<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's fact.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Bitches and cream, that blows. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You have tickets. You owe the police money. A lot of money. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Fu-udge-sicles. Anyways, how was your weekend? <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's Tuesday afternoon!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Good good, yeah, mine was bad. Really bad, actually. I got arrested for doing 90 in a zero. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: A zero?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Well there's no like sign or anything but it was a freakin' kindergarden so yeah, I think you're supposed to go zero! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Look, I know this is a small thing to bring up but before, when you first called and I said 'where are you?' and you thought I said 'how are you?' . . . you said you were good.  <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, please don't do this now, OK? I'm being held without bail, so it would be really nice just to hear someone say that it is not my fault. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I do think it's your fault. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: There you go again with the talkie-talkie!

[talking to himself] So, if I eat it and two days later I take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. But if I put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. I don't understand what the difference is. It's not his. It's gone. But he just latches on. He latches on and I can't let it get to me. I just have to let it go-- IT'S A FRICKIN' KIT KAT BAR, MAN! It's 99 cents! What do you want?! A quarter? You want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? Just forget it, man! Just pretend that I dropped it on the ground and I didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why don't we just move on?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Well, I'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay? Say something! You're obviously pissed!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes, I am pissed! I said I just wish you didn't throw it away.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah? Well, sometimes wishes don't come true. I'm sorry.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Whatever.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I mean, when I was six I had a wish, too. I had a wish that everybody I knew would be dead.

I try to give you a golden gift and you sock me in the face.

Are you a nucking futcase? Hey, here's a question: if I bought this gift for myself, why'd I do this? (slams it down on his knee)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No!<br />\n<br />\n(Jake continues to ax kick it in the desk, then stomp it on the ground.)<br />\n<br />\nSARAH: That's--<br />\n<br />\n(Jake grabs Amir's bags out of his hands)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Why--<br />\n<br />\n(Jake throws them on the ground, then stomps everything furiously.)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Somehow holding the backs again) Why?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How's that for overreacting, bitch?!

He turns around and holds his arms out, in a what now? manner.)<br />\n<br />\n(The audio of the next scene starts before the video.)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n[Jake is in another part of the office, on the phone with Apple support while examining the crushed iPad box.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yep, that's H-U-R-W-I-T-Z, and the iPad was broken.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Well it's under warranty so I'll tell you exactly what happened. I broke it over my friggin knee, and then I stomped it, with my friggin boot! (laughs)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah I activated the warranty, they do that for you.. automatically in the store, alright, sister?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ok.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Wow, alright. Then I'll do it now. Then I'll activate the warranty now.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (shaking his head) You gotta-- you gotta learn how to be funny, man. (the video cuts to black) I expect a full refund.

Hey, listen. Can I borrow your phone? I just got beeped.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You have a phone.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Upgraded it. Alright, I'm living in beepersville now. (kisses beeper) Oh! That's cherry.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's not an upgrade.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Alright, ya Steve Jobs f*cker, sorry it's not a frickin' iPad Nano, just give me your phone, I gotta call someone back.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Use your desk phone!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I gotta call this number back 'cause it says 9-1-1 at the end of it which means emergency, okay, and if I don't get back to it soon then it's gonna beep me again anyway!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (passing his phone) Alright, just don't cry! (simultaneously) God, here.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (simultaneously) I just need something.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You cry to get your way like a four-year-old, that's so pathetic. That is ridiculous.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (on phone) Yellow? Yes, the doctor speaking. Alright, this is what you need to do, uh, I'm thinking 20 CC's of dialysis administered vaginally. Which is- yeah. No, I- uh- nurse. (chuckling) I'm sorry, I went to medical school. Alright, I get paid the big bucks to make the boo-boos go away. So, (chuckles). Talk back again and we'll make it 40 CC's. Alright, make that 60. Great. Alright, 80 CC's, keep talking. Thank you. Alright, bye, 100 CC's. (hangs up)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Where did you get that beeper?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I didn't get it. Ok, I ganked it. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's still getting it.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Why, where did you gank yours? Radio shack? You know I'm surprised that you can even talk to me right now with Steve Jobs' balls in your mouth.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You're being really crass today. How did you get a beeper from a doctor's office?   <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Bachelor party last weekend. Yeah, my friend from high school, Marty's getting married so you know I came to play. (laughs) First step is a nice, little brunch with his family and I'm already a little buzzed after three Four Lokos and a shot of schnapps, some bozo jokingly dares me to bite into a glass of orange juice. (laughs) Before he even gets to the just kidding I am tooth-deep in the thing. I'm not an idiot, okay, so I think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. I'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. Alright, next thing I know I'm in the back of Donnie's Camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. I'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. To make matters worse I wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. So I start passing out, you know, Nature's Promise and all.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's a butter company.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I wake up in post-op four hours later and I needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because I've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Doesn't sound standard.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: They choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. Uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. So I book it, alright. Cut to interior, hospital, day, later, I am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. Medical equipment everywhere, alright. The beeper falls onto the ground and I just jump on it like a Nazi taking a grenade for his German cohorts. He looks passed out, but I'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so I shove the beeper three inches into my butt and I just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. I'm three towns over before I even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point I'm thanking God because my groin is torn to shreds.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: So that beeper was in your butt?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: For 14 miles. And the bitch still works. (winks)<br />\n<br />\nTHE END<br />\n<br />\nEPISODE LINK<br />\n",

[put hands together and bows]<br />\n<br />\nJ: That's really offensive.<br />\n<br />\nA: I just really needed to get out of the house, so I appreciate it.<br />\n<br />\nJ: Okay, well I'm still pretty pissed at you about last night.<br />\n<br />\nA: [confused] ...Is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because I'm sorry, I was a little bit gone.<br />\n<br />\nJ: You were ENTIRELY gone, okay? You showed up three hours late and you were begging to the point of tears to change the locashe.<br />\n<br />\nA: Yeah, I say a LOT of funny things. <br />\n<br />\nJ: It wasn't funny. You openly wept for a venue change for my friend's birthday party at her apartment to a quote college dive around the corner from this shithole.<br />\n<br />\nA: I thought the party needed a new energy, okay?! [starts waving his hands and dancing] Sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -<br />\n<br />\nJ: [interrupting] Right, no, no, no, I get that, but the party had a fine energy, right? They were lighting the birthday candles and then you blew them all out and you said Happy birthday to pee! and then you whipped out your penis and tried to urinate on the cake - but couldn't -<br />\n<br />\nA: [interrupting, irritated/defensive] I had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.<br />\n<br />\nJ: Okay, I'm not upset that you couldn't pee, I'm upset that you tried. Then you ran outside and a few of us followed you because you yelled I'm gonna go outside and legit hurt myself to teach you all a fucking lesson.<br />\n<br />\nA: A lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about THAT for a second?<br />\n<br />\nJ: Not right now, okay? Once we were outside you asked my friend if she dared you to headbutt the windshield of a car until it broke. When she said no, you took off in a dead sprint and said You owe me five bucks, you sasquatch! and then you lowered your head and ran full speed into the bumper of a truck.<br />\n<br />\n[one cut during Jake's speech of Amir bobbing his head]<br />\n<br />\nA: That reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. An Abe Lincolner.<br />\n<br />\nJ: We heard a DEAFENING crack - like a log being broken over a rock - and you fell completely motionless to the ground. We thought you had broke your neck.<br />\n<br />\nA: [trying to imitate Mike Posner] You probably think, you think you're cooler than me.<br />\n<br />\n[Jake glares at Amir, who blinks slowly]<br />\n<br />\nJ: ...your legs didn't work anymore after that, so you started scooting down the street on your butt, screaming I'm Lieutenant Dan!

Is this the first time you're getting a little embarrassed?<br />\n<br />\n[cut to Amir still shaking his head, then back to Jake]<br />\n<br />\nJ: Okay, I'm gonna keep on going...Okay, you whipped out your penis ONE more time; you said, follow my trail of pee to victory, but once again, you could not produce any urine - <br />\n<br />\nA: [angry] I HAD JUST DRAINED - <br />\n<br />\nJ: [interrupting] The main vein. No, I remember that. Do you remember the skateboarder that rode by? He saw your penis and laughed at you?<br />\n<br />\nA: [squints and scratches his chin, then looks at Jake] ...Vaguely?<br />\n<br />\nJ: You started crying? You said, Let's see your guido dick! I have a big penis and you have a string beanis!<br />\n<br />\nA: [rubbing his fingers on his temple] I'm sorry, is there a point to this story?<br />\n<br />\nJ: You asked me why I was mad.<br />\n<br />\nA: [angry] Why don't you ask me why I'M mad, okay?! You take me to a slumpbuster festival, I haven't gotten any in like weeks - I'm on a 2-month dry spell - and EVERYBODY is outta my league.<br />\n<br />\nJ: [confused] You just said it was a slumpbuster festival, now they're out of your league?<br />\n<br />\nA: THEY'RE BOTH, OKAY.

I was holding like 30 bags of Funyuns and I couldn't get into my pockets again. So you took out your security card. (Jake shakes his head) No, right? I brought me here. (winks)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: What was that?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: That was a wink.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You winked at Jake.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Yeah, because Jake brought me here.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Come on<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Listen, I'm the head of H.R., right?

Sorry, I was still talking, what is your name?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: My name? Is that what you want to know? (AMIR: Yeah.) Because I'm a totally different person that you've ever seen. My name is...Fm-mm...<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFLASHBACK<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Most important rule when we're in there: If he asks you your name, don't hesitate.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I never hesitate, I'm amazing at thinking of new names.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No, you're not that good.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I'm amazing, unique names.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Alright, practice. What's your name?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: My name is Qu-Qu-Crowlidit-Cowlideen? San.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: See, this is a good example of stuttering, making up a name.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Mmmm...<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: This is not good, Ok, think of a name before we go in, that's all I'm saying.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I got one, I got one in my back pocket. I just memorized it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What is it?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: My name?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Se-Shannon-Shoonith?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Then you didn't just memorize it, Ok, look, if you need to, just use the name, Jim. Ok?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Not gonna have to.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Alright, but just in case you can't think of something-<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Don't think of a just in case, I'll just use what I got.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Alright, what's your name?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: My name? Ask me what my name is.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I just did. What is your name.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Ask me my name?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I just did. I said, what's your name?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: My name is... Shhhsscaal-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Jim!<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Nope. I know what my name is. My name is Scalby...Scalby-Lawfsoos.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Scalby-Lawfsoos?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: is my fist name, my last name is... Jim.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Can we talk about what we came here to talk about?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Yeah, absolutely. Amir, you stink. Ugh, you stink.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: At what?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: At just smelling bad.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So I smell good?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Yuck, I messed that up. I messed that up. There's only one thing to do. (standing up) Jake, I'm going rogue.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFLASHBACK<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ok, just promise me one thing. Don't go rogue.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I don't even know what that means, what does it mean to go rogue?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's good, don't worry about it. Just don't stray. Ok?<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Hey, don't worry. This Joe won't be Rogen.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That was bad.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Seth won't be Rogen.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Even worse, Ok, just stay on topic, is what I'm saying.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Don't go rogue!<br />\n<br />\nBEN: It's too late, I'm roguein' right now.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You said you didn't even know what it meant!<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I said a lot of things, I ate all those Funyuns, I didn't throw them out. You ready? Take off your clothes.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (Amir starts taking shirt off) Hey, hey, stop, look. If he blindly follows your instructions, just tell him to shower.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: I can't do that, this is way smarter.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (standing up) Ok, I'm gonna go.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: No, don't go, this is the best part!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Jake!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (tries to turn handle) We're locked in.<br />\n<br />\nBEN: (gasps)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (gasps)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (gasps)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (pause, laughs)<br />\n<br />\nBEN: Huh!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ugh.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (farts)<br />\n<br />\nBEN: (signature Ben Scwartz whale-laugh) <br />\n<br />\nTHE END<br />\n<br />\nEPISODE LINK<br />\n",

Alright, how was that bitch? <br />\n<br />\nJake: You just ruined it! <br />\n<br />\n[Jake and Amir at their desks, both laughing] <br />\n<br />\nJake: laughs Oh, that does make sense because the subway wasn't running today. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, I know. I was just down there and I pressed the emergency breaks, you know? Which brings the whole thing to like a standstill. And we were stuck down there for like... a day. laughs<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes! I remember you came up above ground finally and everyone was chanting Asshole!<br />\n<br />\nAmir (powdering his face): Yeah, that's not the first time that's happened. laughs<br />\n<br />\nJake: Whoa... <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, third grade talent show, decided to do standup comedy but my material was a little... raunchy. laughs I was booed off the stage, but my dad was so embarrassed that he moved. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Alright, that's sad, but I was talking about the makeup. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: What? <br />\n<br />\nJake: You're putting powder on your face. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah. I have oily skin. It's a greasy t-zone. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Do you wash your face? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Don't need to. laughs I just use the powder. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Then you do need to wash you-<br />\n<br />\nAmir (interrupting Jake): The trick is to make it look like you're not wearing a lot. <br />\n<br />\nJake: That's the trick for girls. The trick for guys is just to never wear any makeup. <br />\n<br />\nAmir (closing his compact): Alright, lemme tell you a story. In sixth grade, I was bullied so hard that my dad almost moved. Instead, my teacher called a parental mediation session. So it was just me and my dad, the tormenter and the tormenter's foster mom. They all ganged up on me so hard, that my dad moved. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Sorry, your dad ganged up on you so hard that he moved? <br />\n<br />\nAmir (powdering his face): Yes. <br />\n<br />\nJake: How does this relate to oily skin? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: It doesn't relate to oily skin. Okay? I just wear makeup, alright? Maybe you should care about your personal appearance too. You might look a little better. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Stand up! <br />\n<br />\n(Amir stands up) <br />\n<br />\nJake: Turn around! <br />\n<br />\n(Amir turns around) <br />\n<br />\nJake: Great! I just wanted to make sure I was getting fashion advice from the guy who shit his pants three weeks ago and has yet to clean them. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Ooh! Easy fix! (powders his butt) <br />\n<br />\nJake: That's not- No! That doesn't fix it. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Says the guy who got his pubes waxed everyday for like a month. <br />\n<br />\nJake: I didn't do that. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm talking about me. And you know what? I developed such a bad rash after my 30th full brazilian in as many days that you know what my dad did? <br />\n<br />\nJake: Moved? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: He frickin' moved!<br />\n",

Will you please start wearing pants to these.<br />\n<br />\nAmir:Relax.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [Talking to three high school age boys and handing them each some cash] Thank you so much. Honestly, I mean I don't know what you do with this money but it's like yours to keep.<br />\n<br />\nJake:[Walking to his desk] Yo, what's going on?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: None ya!<br />\n<br />\n[Jake raises his eyebrows]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You're not curious to know what that means?

Why are you paying these teenagers money?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: First of all, okay, they're not teenagers. They're all fifteen years old.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Then they're teenagers.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [Turning to the teenagers] You guys lied to me.<br />\n<br />\nJake: They didn't lie to you okay, you misconstrued that.How do you know them?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: They were in second grade uh, when I was in second grade, so [Amir high fives all three of them in a row].<br />\n<br />\nJake: How? They're half your age?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I was held back. Constantly, if you must know. Eight straight years in second grade before I decided to turn it on. Alright, I flip it on like a light switch. I'm powering through third, fourth, fifth grade, sixth grade comes along, I open my stupid little trap, and the hammer comes down!<br />\n<br />\nJake: So you didn't talk for four years?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Not a peep! Alright, but then they find out that my reading is still at a second grade level and my math just isn't there.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So it sounds like you didn't turn it on.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, turns out I just left it off. They shipped me back to second grade with my tail between my legs and every teacher in the hallway just booing me. I spent another nine and a half spottin' second grade. I didn't say a peep the entire time! But hey, at this point, they're already hip to that game so they just keep me there.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So you didn't talk for ten years?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Not a peep.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Stop saying peep.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Mum was the fricken' peep.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's enough. I don't know what you guys are doing here but you all can just go home alright, peace out [Jake gives them the peace sign].<br />\n<br />\nTeenager 1: That's not cool.<br />\n<br />\nJake: [Puts up peace sign] This isn't cool? Alright dude, I'll stop doing it.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: They're tutoring me.<br />\n<br />\nJake: They're tutoring you? Okay, yeah, and my shirts grey [sarcastic].<br />\n<br />\nTeenager 2: Your shirt is grey.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Its steel! Okay! Why don't I tutor you in having eyes.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: They're tutoring me in math, English, Physics...<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh, they're tutoring you in math? Here's a pop quiz, eight times eight.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Ah, eight squared! You guys just taught me this.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Woah, woah,woah, excuse me dude, eight squared? I said eight times eight! [Jake starts pointing to his eyes] Listen!<br />\n<br />\nTeenager 1: It's the same thing.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Who are you man? Alright look, either way he's not gonna get it.<br />\n<br />\nTeenager 3: Come on Amir! You can do it!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Woah, woah, woah! Foul on the play! No doing that dude. You can't encourage him. He's got to do it himself. <br />\n<br />\nTeenager 1: He is.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Not with you guys smiling at him, believing in him, saying [Jake starts in a mocking voice] Oh Amir, come on you can do it! You coddle him like a child. It's pathetic.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh, 64!<br />\n<br />\nJake: [Starts clapping] Bravo. Bravo. You guys tutored him to cheat, with a calculator under the desk. [Jake bends down to look under the desk and bangs his forehead down on top of it.] AH! Oh, no. Ow! Okay, no calculator under there but ay, who left this desk here? Haha. [Jake starts looking bad and puts his hand on his stomach] I'm gonna vomit.<br />\n<br />\nTeenager 1: You should lie down.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You should lie up! Who are you!

You missed it. You hit your glasses again. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah. Hey, do you have someone you could set me up with, like on a date?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Um. I don't know, man. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Just. I'm lonely and horny, so. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, Definitely not. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, I've been on 5 dates in my life man. All right? The first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  Two of the girls I gave pink eye to.  Fourth one, she ended up super, super pissed, but not at me. Fifth one, I really cannot for the life of me remember, oh right! No, you know what?  You killed her with a bus! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I di--I don't want to set you up with any of my friends, OK? Sorry.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: OK, are you afraid of me not being me on the date?

Let's say we're on the date right now. Where have you taken me?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Here's something cute and quirky.  Let's order dessert first. Haha, that's weird, I'm different. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: OK, you're trying too hard. Why don't you tell me about some of your hobbies. <br />\n<br />\nAMIE: All right, let's just be frank, all right? I want one thing, and one thing only. A one night stand. Only at the end of the night, we won't be standing. I want to lay down and hug you. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: A lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. Well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. I never kiss, and always tell. (chuckles) I keep telling people how much I've never kissed. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Do you realize you haven't answered a single one of my questions?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And at the conclusion of the night, we walk home, I rub my hand against the dirty park bench, and just start rubbing your eyes.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: So, the pink eye thing.  It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.   <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, well they probably did. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Sorry. Is this still in character, like we're on the date?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (getting worked up) What do you mean, no?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I mean, I don't want to do this anymore.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Is this why you invited me to this restaurant?

All right, my heart is exposed right now and you can either tear it out, or s- or say yes and make me the happiest man ever.  <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: We're not really breaking up. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (sighs) Thank gosh, promise?

It's kinda like MySpace but for college kids, it's all interactive.<br />\nJake:  Right, that's not true, I said I was on it.<br />\nAmir:  You don't think it's interactive?<br />\nJake:  Just, what's your point?<br />\nAmir:  I'm saying these privacy settings they're completely wack.<br />\nJake:  Meaning?<br />\nAmir:  Oh, come on, you gotta be pretty naïve to think Zark Fuckerberg isn't selling our shit to Skymall for kickbacks at this point.<br />\nJake:  Just type it all up in an email and send it to me.<br />\nAmir:  Ok, no no.  Explain to me how my account gets hacked every day.<br />\nJake:  Sometimes I see your facebook password as you status message.<br />\nAmir:  [exasperated]  Yeah, because I think I'm logged out but I'm not, ok!?  So I'm typing it in but it's my status!<br />\nJake:  Don't yell at me like that's not an answer to your question.<br />\nAmir:  I'm just saying that some of these privacy settings are legit anus-infested, ok?  Everybody-Like every rando with a smartphone and an AOL account could just access my pics.<br />\nJake:  Your pics?  You have one facebook album titled 'Another Day at the Races' and there's only one photo in here and it appears to be you at a dog pound bottomless with peanut butter all over your flaccid penis, you're surrounded by ten puppies and each one of them is ignoring you. <br />\nAmir:  I need to untag it.<br />\nJake:  You need to delete it from the internet entirely.  Ok, you're wearing a shirt that's like eight sizes too big and it reads 'don't be offended if you're a dog lover - so am I' and the caption of the photo is 'who wants to see me get my D wet' subcaption 'you're gay if you click this' subcaption 'delete' subcaption -<br />\nAmir: [interrupts]  Subcaption!

Subcaption: your facebook password.<br />\nAmir:  I thought I was logged the fuck out!<br />\nJake:  How about this?  Just calm down, let's calm down.  Look at the groups you're a member of.<br />\nAmir:  I am calm.<br />\nJake:  'One million strong against the new facebook,'  '10 million strong against the facebook redesign,' '100 million to say that Facebook is spying on us,' 'Amir Blumenfelds of the world unite.'  This last one, 'If one billion people join this group I'll slam my nuts in the door.'  All of them you're the only member, and this last one you uploaded the video... [clicks] It's you slamming your nuts in the door!  Why would you do that before anybody joined?<br />\nAmir:  Because I wanted to sweeten the deal!  Alright, I wanted to let people know what was in store for them if they signed up for the frickin' group!<br />\nJake:  So you actually just went and slammed your nuts in the door?!<br />\nAmir:  Well, ah, ok, here's the thing.  I got amped up, right, I was trying to pump myself up to actually do the video one day and I said you know what, I'm ready, so I end up slamming my nuts in the door, and what am I gonna do?  Just sit on the video? No, I decided to upload it, and you know what?-<br />\nJake: [interrupts] It has three views!<br />\nAmir:  Exactly!  And you know what?  Those three views they're probably all from a frickin' Skymall and Zark Fuckerberg he's walking around right now with massage boots over his head because it's a kickback from the frickin' mall!<br />\n",

But not before proving my worth to the instructor by picking up the biggest weight I could find... The weight to the women's locker room. Hahah.<br />\n<br />\nJake - (looks unamused)<br />\n<br />\nAmir - Didn't think you'd get that. Now I actually bend down to pick up a barbell that probably grossed about 80 kilos and pop goes my weasel. My back is pulled like a pork sandwich in pot-tuckey.<br />\n<br />\nJake - I don't wanna hear the whole story man, ok. You're only on day one.<br />\n<br />\nAmir - I practiced like... ok. <br />\n<br />\nJake - Ok.<br />\n<br />\nAmir - It's just that I practiced a lot you know, that story was very very memorized, and the metaphors were very tight, ok.

Hell time at high noon day.

You start every entry with 'dear diary'.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: As a goof.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: On who?? You wrote, 'dear diary, Jake hasn't complimented me in a million days' which sounds like an exaggeration because two days ago in a date marked October and 40th--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: All Hallow's Eve. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Nope. You wrote, 'Jake complimented me today.' Which I actually don't remember. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah! You were texting, OK?

No, I'm in the cool group, and we all agree that your daughter is a zero. She's less than a zero, and guess what? She's gonna wake up with cheese in her ears tomorrow morning, which ain't gonna help the situation. (chuckles) Y'know what, good, call the cops. I just won't show up then. (chuckles) Actually... can you not, because I wanted to show up and do the milk—well, I don't wanna get arrested! So now I can't go—I dropped a G on this frickin' tux, sir! This was supposed to be the most magical night of my life, and you're basically telling me not—that I can't go, because I'm—okay. Great. Bye. (hangs up) Yeah, my night just opened up hard, so we can hang out. I might wanna call in a bomb threat though, y'know; if the fuzz are gonna be there, we might as well frickin' make them earn their keep.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (talking on phone) Ah, Mickey, my friend! (laughs) Good news, sir! There was no traffic, and I am there early! Come outside. That body you're about to see hanging out of a stretch Hummerzine? That is me, my friend! That is all me. (laughs) Can you see me? I'm waving my hands, Mickey! Nah, you can't see me, because I'm not there, Mickey. I got stood up to prom, Mickey, and now you are too! Yeah, Operash Milk? That's a no-go. I don't c—I don't know, man; you spent two weeks on a dairy farm. (laughing) That's not my problem anymore! That's your milk, your problem, Mickey! The operash is a no-go like I said, Mickey.

Give me one thing to hone in on. It's so broad.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'm not going to give you one thing. You always want one thing.There are thousands of screenplay rules, right? And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Focus it.

It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You should've heard Mr. Nort deliver that line. He nailed it in callbacks.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You're not annoyed we went with Nort over you?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You were seriously considered.

That's why I tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan on a whim. Ready for the rub?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No! You know what? I'm not.

Do you realize how hard that is? Sorry for caring.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You don't care.

Right?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah, I'm her soulmate.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Really, because I've never seen you here.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Really, that's because there's a difference between being a soulmate and being pathetic.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh, is there a difference between being a murderer and being pathetic?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Wow. Wow.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Really?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, really!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You went there. Okay!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, I went there!

You punched her in the stomach!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Maybe I'm dead then...<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's not how that works.<br />\n<br />\nLerona: (in pain) I'm Lerona's twin sister.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You look.. just like her!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Only you're...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alive...<br />\n<br />\nLerona: I'm Jessica.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You know, I always thought Lerona had, like, the brightest eyes in the world, but, uh... turns out they were only second to yours.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, yours are brighter. And she had a lazy eye, which you don't.<br />\n<br />\nJake: She did! Yes, it was like all over there! (pointing)<br />\n<br />\nAmir: She was always like—Where is she look—She could watch two TVs at once. (laughs with Jake) <br />\n<br />\nJake: (laughing) Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I always joked about that.<br />\n<br />\nLerona: Okay, well—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Ooh, let me smell your breath!<br />\n<br />\nLerona: What, uh— [Amir sniffs Lerona's breath.]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Doesn't even resemble dog food! Yeah!<br />\n<br />\nJake: (simultaneously) Dog food! Yes!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What was that?!<br />\n<br />\nJake: I swear to god I saw the bitch eat Kibbles 'n Bits once, I guess, as a reward for herself, all right?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah!<br />\n<br />\nJake: She said it was a Fun Size Snickers, but I smelled it and I saw it!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It was, like, a crispy dog biscuit, all right?<br />\n<br />\nLerona: No—<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes. Yes.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It was, like, a crispy dog bone-shaped biscuit.<br />\n<br />\nLerona: (interjecting) Anyway!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Thank you!<br />\n<br />\nLerona: What?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Anyway! Not anyways.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Lerona used to always say anyways.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (simultaneously, nasally) Anyways!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Anyways.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (nasally) Anyways!<br />\n<br />\nJake: It was like ants.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh god, so nasal!<br />\n<br />\nJake: So annoying...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Just that one word.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So annoying.<br />\n<br />\nLerona: Yeah, well, so are you two! (to Amir) I mean, you—you act like a four-year-old in a twenty-eight-year-old's body.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (inaudible)<br />\n<br />\nLerona: (to Jake) And you—Jake, you stole your best friend's girlfriend, and then you killed her.<br />\n<br />\nJake: ...Wow.<br />\n<br />\nLerona: Oh, and by the way, fedoras are not stylin'.<br />\n<br />\nJake: How did you know...?<br />\n<br />\nLerona: Because I'm not Lerona's twin, okay? I am a ghost. I came back here to see what nice things you guys would be saying about me, and instead, you're flirting with my fake sibling and talking shit about me.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Barely, okay? I like the way you ate dog food; Jake was the one being a bitch by (inaudible)<br />\n<br />\nJake: No, what—I like dog food!<br />\n<br />\nLerona: (interrupting) You know what? Whatevers. Bye.

Put a net around him and dragged his ass to Yankees Stadium, put him on trial in front of the fearless fans of Bronx's Alpha, parked his car in the Harvard yard, took him to the square.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's Boston.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Only it wasn't Osama bin Laden; it was my dad. And it wasn't Yankees Stadium, either, it was like my elementary school and I was naked.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Ok, so now you're talking about like a dream you had, did you pass out or something?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Mhm. Yeah I fainted, twice. Today, actually. Once at my aunt's condo on the way over here in a bowl of cereal, and another on like a subway platform, and when I came to there were 35 police officers looking down on me, told me I missed the train by like half an inch. I was this close-<br />\n<br />\nJake: Alright, stop talking. You're saying, like a million different things at once and the only person who can juggle that many things at once is named yours truly. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Alright leave! Everybody just leave, leave, alright? I'll make a video of me juggling, but for now; screw you guys, you need to go home. Alright, Murph, you're lucky you're a bitch, that would've hit you square.

Ow.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah, I know. I can see it from the front, so I was just kinda reminding you that you should get it drained.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah I got this badboy (taps his headset).

It's not yours, I don't see why you care.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You just asked me to talk to you about it.

Oh right I remember where you were, 100%, firmly placed, inside of, my snatch.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Stop saying snatch. Who just called you?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: None of your bitchness.<br />\n<br />\nJake: It actually is my bitchness because you're running a phone sex hotline at work—and now my phone's ringing. Did you post my number <br />\ntoo?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I don't think... no.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Okay well it's coming from an area code that I don't recognize.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: 732?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Jersey. I mean, is it?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Okay well, yeah, well I guess you spend a lot of time in New Jersey on the weekends.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Sometimes I spend gas station time there, but like nothing more than that.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Okay, well I'm going to know if you posted my number if I answer this and it's somebody that I don't know asking me what I'm <br />\nwearing.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Which is why I swear to god that I didn't leave your phone number.<br />\n<br />\nJake: (Talking on the phone) Hello? (Hangs up) Yeah. That guy's jerking off.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I left your phone number.

Though I am happy that you're not wearing that ugly fedora anymore. And those dog tags.<br />\nJAKE: I'm still wearing the dog tags, alright? But you know what, I'm glad that this isn't gonna work out because fashion is the #1 most important thing in my life, and you don't got it.

(interrupted by Amir)  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Woah woah slow down I wasn't listening.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Slow down or you weren't listening?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What's the difference?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Well one implies you were giving some effort but I was just talking too fast, the other one is just that you're being an asshole Interrupted by Amir  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Woah woah slow down!  <br />\n<br />\nJake: So it was the second one?  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Second WHAT!  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You then rolled up a hundred dollar bill, shoved it in Karens ear and lit the tip of it on fire, screaming Enjoy this ear candle you dumb bitch, it's half the price of a cock future and unlike you it's guaranteed to blow smoke up my ass. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, which got a huge laugh.<br />\n<br />\nJake: A lot of people tried to tackle you.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: So why doesn't Obama just like cut a check and call it a day?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You think Obama would be the one to cut a check? Amir shrugs They needed more than a Trillion dollars.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh a trillion. Which is?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: A thousand billion<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Right. Which is?<br />\n<br />\nJake: A thousand million, which is a thousand thousand, which is a thousand dollars, which is how much four chicken nuggets cost.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Got it. (Amir attempts to throw a chicken nugget into his mouth but misses)<br />\n<br />\nJake: Where did you get that?<br />\n(Amir making a weird face while Jake talks) Security came to escort you out; you got down on your hands and knees and begged Karen for just one of her cock futures, you said: I'm sure my dad would be disappointed to see me grovelling, but the look in his eyes when I show him I'm the certified owned of a cock future, would surely erase 28 years of disapproval.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm a coward and a fool! .. I feel like the word staunch was co opted by the right, I mean like you can be a staunch Republican, but you can't be a staunch Democrat? like who made those rules —  (Jake interrupts)  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You can be a staunch Democrat — (Amir interrupts jake)<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I don't interrupt you, ok, I don't interrupt your stand ups so don't interrupt mine, sorry but..  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You do interrupt me a lot, not necessarily during my stand up — (Amir interrupts)<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Name one time I interrupted you.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You're interrupting me right now —<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Name one time!<br />\n<br />\nJake: It's happening right now — (*Amir interrupting: I defy YOU *), this is interruption!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I feel like we don't need money if everyone just decided to use..(Jake interrupts)  <br />\n<br />\nJake: I know, Chucky Cheese tokens instead of money, right, you said that maybe too much during the meeting.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: [Tickles Jake] Are you ticklish?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes, I'm very ticklish but your hands are so cold, and wet and clammy that I'm just grossed out..<br />\nYou then pissed yourself, and you were dragged out of the meeting a second time, while you were screaming The audacity of NOPE, which sounds like some weird tea party slogan. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm a member.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: [Amir tries tickling jake again] Yeah, like that feels like I'm being poked with cold crab claws.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: [Holding up a 100$ bill and trying to burn it with a lighter while Jake tries to stop him] Alright come on, just let go man.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: You did not learn your lesson yet. That'll be 300$ on the day!<br />\nOk, then so even though the debt ceiling was raised, our credit rating dropped so the stocks tanked.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, that's why I keep my money in a freaking box, man.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: That's not smart.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, well didn't you lose money this year?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: .. and in 2008?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Right i did but...   <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Well my box didn't depreciate in value, ok, I actually made more money investing in Nothing [laughs].  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Fine, where's your box?  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Here's a quiz.. I lost it.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: So then from inside the meeting we heard you threaten to make your face red until you passed out, which I guess you did, because then nobody heard from you for 30 minutes.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, which felt like like a second on my end.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Right, because you had stopped breathing.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: For like a second on my end.  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes, on your end, but like for 30 minutes in real life.  <br />\n<br />\n[Amir tries to flick his fingers]  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Booyakasha?  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Borat, yeah. Ok, so how do you know so much?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Newspapers, alright, it's not hard to stay informed; you read an hour a day, New York Times, Wall Street Journal..  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: How do you actually know so much?  <br />\n<br />\nJake: Daily show..(Amir: got it) I watch the Colbert Report.  <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah..

Which means it's bad. Which means I'm pissed. Okay, the big three.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Those all sound like one thing.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: No, I've kept quiet till now, but I'm gonna make a Facebook group about it.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You didn't keep quiet at all!

And looking at your Facebook profile, it looks like, wow, yeah, you've protested every single Facebook redesign!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I deleted those groups!<br />\n<br />\nJake: First of all, you didn't. Second of all, that doesn't change my point. Look at this first group, okay? Four years ago: Ten thousand strong against the Facebook newsfeed—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Newsfeed, yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Facebook was flawless and now it's garbage. They had a perfect game going.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It was garbage. Yeah, they jumped the shark.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Fine. Six months later you wrote, Holy carp, why change perfection? Facebook is without flaw, but new design change makes it official: they just jumped the shark.

It filled up.<br />\n<br />\nJake: No it didn't. No members—you're not even a member! Jesus Christ! Next one: Delete the Facebook Graffiti Wall. It's a joke and a fool. Two weeks later: One million strong to bring back Graffiti Wall. I know I abused it, but I miss it.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Straight up, they jumped the carp, when they lost the Graffiti Wall. Like...<br />\n<br />\nJake: Lemme ask you a question: do you notice a pattern?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [In a whiny and very high-pitched voice] Yeah, Facebook jumps the frickin' shark, okay? Every time they have a perfect game going and they fricking sell out! They jump the carp!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh my god, your voice is painful! Look, here's another thing man: every single week you try to start a national Deactivate Facebook Day. Like, here's one that says Zark Fuckerberg is gonna start charging for Facebook. Please read now and delete your account.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: He started. He started charging, seven bucks a pop.<br />\n<br />\nJake: No he didn't!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: He didn't, because enough people joined the group!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh my god, the facts are in on Twitter: Facebook was perfect but they just made it Myspace! NO!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You know you said that two years ago: Ten million strong against the new Facebook, cause they just made it Myspace.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: [Crying] Yeah, cause it sucked!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh my god, stop crying! You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. Like, you don't get the Internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying—<br />\n<br />\nJake: By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, you know why?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Cause they jumped the shark—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Cause they jumped the car—the, yeah—the shark, exactly right.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOriginal Location<br />\n<br />\nEpisode Link<br />\n<br />\nSpare me your change.<br />\n",

Only problem is, Uh oh, mommy's lying supine underneath my back tires threatening to sue me if I run over her head like a fricken' coconut.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Jesus Christ...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: My Hanukkah wish, didn't come true cause my old man is just pushin' the hood of the car beggin' to the only god he knows to run the bitch over and I'm ridin' shotgun with my hand on the E-brake while the old maid is in the back fricken' planking underneath my back tires, kissing the pavement, begging me to fucking run her over too.  I'm crying like a coward up there right, screaming It's a set-up, it's a set-up!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why did you even go home?!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I was asking myself the same question when my dad popped a squat on the windshield of my rented Kia Sorento and tried to drop a deuce.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Tried?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah! Tried.  Turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  Looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  So I flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the Sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  Flip a U-bang and I start humming to myself ♪Silent Night♪.  Only problem is I'm sad as hell.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah, I would be too.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: But I figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so I swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  Yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh no...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh no is...wrong!  Yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when I get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, RIP, thanks to you, Amir.  Can you believe that?  Callin' me out like that?  Rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh that's another thing.  I brought home a Thai whore just to show my dad that I had a mate in life.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: He means well.<br />\n<br />\nJake: No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: How's this for a happy ending?  New Years Eve Eve, December 39th.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Wrong.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I get a call from a jail in Fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  I'm alone, not doing anything anyway so I toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'No to bail his ass out.  He pretends he doesn't even recognize me, his only daughter!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You haven't been right about any of the things you've said, well, ever.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I spend another 15K trying to bail him out of that Alabam Slamma' and he tells the bailiff he'd rather rot in hell than owe that son of a bitch coward, me, a fricken' dime.  Wanna know the icing on the cake?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Not really.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Me and my dad made up and he's coming to live with me in NYC, the big crapple.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That sounds like the worst idea ever.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I thought so too, but he promised to make me a grilled jizz on day one.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Isn't that just when he knocks you out with a...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Cast iron skillet, yeah, right to the back of my fricken' face.  But at least I have a dad.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I have a dad.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm talking about Pat.<br />\n<br />\nPat: You monster!<br />\n",

How Many Words Would It Take by Amir Valarie Blumenfeld.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You know you can change your middle name, right?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Reciting poem)  How many words would it take to accurately express what you mean to me?  How can you scientifically quantify how much lighter I become when you enter my day and how heavy I feel when you leave?  How can I describe how my smile just appears magnetically when  I see your face?  (Jake smiles)  How can I possibly count my thoughts of you when I think of you so constantly?  As thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts, within thoughts make it impossible to remember where one began and the other ended.  Time folds into itself as I am already nostalgic for our future and look forward to our past.  For the rest of my life, I love you.  <br />\n<br />\n(There is a short pause as Jake tries to find the words to say)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Wow...that was...<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: DUMB, I know!

It was really, really good.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I texted the first part of it to myself while I was takin' a shit.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Dude, it was incredible.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And the second part, I was mid-wipe so I just said \"fuck it, I'll leave it as a voicemail to myself\".

Who're you giving that to?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I don't know, I just freestyled it off the top of my dick, probably nobody; I'm gonna can it.

It was better than yours and now it's gone!   <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Points at the heart shaped piece of paper in Jake's hand) What about that?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's a placeholder.  It's a suckier version of the card I wrote; a dummy version.    <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Read it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'll read it to you and if you think it's shwing-worthy then it might just be my actual card.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Um...sh—<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (Clears throat obnoxiously)  (Begins to recite poem)  You are blazing to me.  You are so blazing.  No, you're better than blazing; you're blazin'.  No 'g', just an apostrophe, you don't need a 'g', 'cause I'm your G.  So we drop the 'g'.  (Amir scratches his head)  And tonight, you gonna drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it ain't whack, Girl.  Love, your not-so-secret-admirerer, J-Witz.

A little bit!

We can alternate. People won't ever see us <br />\nwearing the same shirt at the same time. Yeah, they won't say, Oh okay, those two guys are wearing the same shirt. It won't look like <br />\na mirror image!<br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't want to give you [...] go out there wearing the same shirt. You want everyone to think we're twins? You want that to <br />\nhappen! I—oh my god. I don't want that—if you want it to happen, I don't want it to happen. That's why I'm not gonna tell you.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: So yeah, I'll wear it Monday Wednesday Friday, you wear it on Tuesday Thursday, how's that? How's that for a plan?<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's—it's a bad plan.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: How about I get the same shirt as you? It won't even be the same size, it'll be two different shirts, (incoherent babbling), in <br />\nthe same style, same style as it! I—I'm really really stressed out, because I'm afraid that at the end of the day you're not gonna...<br />\n<br />\nJake: I hate—right, right, right, it's—your veins are popping out of your neck so bad! Breathe! Breathe in! Breathe in! Stop yelling <br />\nand breathe! For three seconds.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir stops yelling)<br />\n<br />\nJake: Five, four, alright—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm afraid that you're not even gonna end up telling me what shirt!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh my god! You... Oh... You know what, you couldn't pull this shirt off. [...] You won't look good in this shirt! This shirt—it's <br />\na bad shirt, but I'm a fucking attractive dude so I make it work for me. You know what I'm saying?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Because I can't, like—what I'm gonna walk into a store and go, like, Hey, can I get one that's red and plad just like Jake? <br />\nThey won't know who you are! I'm gonna take a picture and send it to you, but, like, what's that gonna get done? At the end of the day? <br />\nGive me a range. Give me a range. Give me a range, okay? Give me, like, 10 stores, I'll go to each one and I'll figure out which shirt <br />\nyou're wearing.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You—no—that's so pathetic. You're just gonna walk into—?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Why is that pathetic? That I wanna wear a cool shirt? You're wearing that shirt, are you pathetic?<br />\n<br />\nJake: What—? You're about to cry! You're about to cry! Look at your eyes. Look at your eyes.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (Babbling) Are you pathetic? Are you pathetic? Are you pathet—And it's not like I wanna wear one on the same day! It's not like <br />\nI'm gonna wear it on the same day! We can alternate days!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh you want to alternate! So that means, like, I have to call you before work—I have to check in with you to see if you're <br />\nwearing my shirt!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You wear it on Monday, I can wear it on Tuesday, you can wear it on Wednesday, I wear it on Thursday, you wear it on Friday, I <br />\nwear it on Saturday, you wear it Sunday, I can wear it Monday, you can wear it on Tuesday, I can wear it on Wednesday. That's how we <br />\nshould—<br />\n<br />\nJake: I'm not—then we can just share this shirt by your logic, right? Yeah—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah! I wanna do that! I wanna share clothes with you, but I feel like I would sort of ease into that, by getting the same <br />\n<br />\nclothes as you, and then you'd realize that, why are we wasting so much money!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Knowing that you wanna do that ultimately really freaks me out. Stop—I wanna s—<br />\n<br />\nAmir: We should just wear the same clothes! We can wear the same clothes! Put them in the same—!<br />\n<br />\n(They stop yelling over each other)<br />\n<br />\nJake: FINE! I got it at Forever 21! Okay? Are you happy now? Forever 21! There's a unisex section upstairs!<br />\n<br />\n(Amir is suddenly wearing the same shirt)<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I got the shirt. I said I wouldn't get the shirt, and I did. I did get the shirt. I called your bluff, and you lost.<br />\n<br />\nPat: Woah, woah, twinsies! Did you guys plan that, or...?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah.<br />\n",

Oh, sorry. [to Amir] What are you doing?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What? I brought bagels* for the whole company and you're doggin' on me for mentioning, just mentioning that I had a dream? I haven't even gotten into the lurid details yet. And they are wet.<br />\n<br />\n*[Amir pronounces bagel \"bag-el\" as opposed to \"bei-gel\", which is the normal pronunciation]<br />\n<br />\nJake: It was inappropriate.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You bet your ass it was.  Imagine every koala ever, in a bikini.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Did you buy bagels for everybody just so you can act like an asshole?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Ok, fine, congratulations for this.  Guys, everyone throw up your bagels right now.  Throw them up or start paying me for them.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You can't do that.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Guess what? Everyone owes me two bucks now because Jake's doggin' me.  We'll call it a \"Jake doggin' me fee.\"<br />\n<br />\nJake: You showed up with bagels around your nipples.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: As a joke.<br />\nJake: You said \"bagels on me.\"<br />\n<br />\nAmir: As a joke.<br />\n<br />\nJake: And now, you're demanding money, not as a joke, right? You can't do that, it's fucked up.  It's a form of robbery.  It's extortion.  It's also pronounced bagel.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What am I saying?<br />\n<br />\nJake: You're saying bagel.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Right, bagel.<br />\n<br />\nJake: No, wrong it's-<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Bagel.<br />\n<br />\nJake: It's-<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Bagel.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Let me say it.

Ok?<br />\n<br />\nJake: I hate that you can put those on so quickly.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I spend a penny to make two. Do you know what it's like to grow up on the street? To be hood? Or would you rather just suck off Uncle Sam and swallow what he gives ya? By the way, that was my dream last night.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?<br />\n<br />\nAmir [no longer wearing sunglasses]: I could clear five dollars easy street if all y'all just ponied up six dollars apiece for these Ed Bagley juniors! Ok, make my money work for me!<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's not even- how much did you spend on these bagels?<br />\n<br />\nAmir [pulls out a receipt]: Roughly...<br />\n<br />\n[Jake pulls the receipt out of his hand]<br />\nAmir: Don't grab stuff out of my hand, ok?

You use it to get with chicks, it's the most important thing in the world.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I lost my childhood dog today!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: None due respect dude, FUCK your childhood dog!, ok, this is more important.

Will you just go to the bathroom?' Just once I'd like to go to the bathroom not because he's telling me but because I made the decision myself. Jake is chill as shit, but sometimes he's a nerd. I don't even have to go, it's like--(gas)--Oh, oh no. Wow, a little gas. Nothing to see here! -- (AMIR begins to shit, putting his hands on either side of the stall in clear pain). Oh no, here we go. Ohhh, mmmm, oh my God, (poops) poops I shitted again! Wow, that felt big! I'm gonna look down just in a case it's a-- holy shit, yeah, oh my (bleep) that's a record breaker. Three footer, easy, four soaking wet, two dry, two and a half moist, no coil either, just a straight shot. Thicker than a soda can, too. My God, it looks like a boa constrictor trying to get out of a septic tank. I'm a hero and a cool. I gotta snap a pic. W-w-wait! The minute I turn around to snap a pic, the toilet is gonna automatically flush! No! Oh my God! Stop crying, stop crying--okay, cry, cry, let it out, you deserve this! You don't cry that much and even if you did no one would begrudge these tears! Just cry, let it all out, then move past it! Okay okay okay, think! Think think think, you idiot. There's gotta be a way to snag a pic without getting up. Go through your legs. (AMIR tries) Nope, too dark. It's too fricken dark. Ugh, unbelievable. You caught a seventy pound bass and you have to throw it back before (AMIR punches stall wall) anybody even gets to behold its beauty! Good luck bragging about something that doesn't even exist! It looks like ten brown slinkies glued together and nobody's gonna believe a goddamn thing. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<br />\n<br />\nPAT: (at urinal) Are you okay in there, man? It smells like cheese and gasoline.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No, I'm not okay! I just gave birth to a brown elephant trunk and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her to the great unknown!<br />\n<br />\nPAT: (holds nose) Oh my God, that is ripe! (leaves)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (thinking) Just stand up! Just stand up and do it, you coward! There's no way that log's getting flushed down anyway! No, no, no, greater fortunes have been lost on less risky propositions! You have to be rational here!<br />\n<br />\n(AMIR pulls out his phone and calls JAKE)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Jake, listen, it's me--don't hang up, don't hang up, don't hang up, okay? I don't want you to do anything weird, I just need you to come over here and put your hand over the sensor so I can stand up and take a picture of my enormous dump. Hello, hello? Ugh!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (thinking) Dildo! He's a dildo! Ugh! Think, think think think. Uh. This is what you have to do. Take off your shirt and pants, put them over the motion sensor so that it still thinks you're still sitting down, and stand up and take the pic right away! Ha! (claps in head) This makes me a genius, official genius and a cool. From now on nobody will think of Amir Blumenfeld as the guy who couldn't take a shit the size and girth of twelve rubber hoses banded together and dipped and brown paint, no! But rather as a pimp and a philosopher. The best two things you can be. <br />\n<br />\n(a MAN walks into the bathroom; upon smelling AMIR's stench, he immediately runs out)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (thinking) Okay, here we go, Hurwitz. Turn around and snag the pic. Your life as you know it will officially change. Promise me this. Whatever people say, you'll stay humble. (aloud) I promise. (thinking) Three, two, one...<br />\n<br />\n(AMIR stands up and tries to take the picture. His shirt, pants, and cell phone all are flushed, as well as his enormous dump)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh no! No, no, no!<br />\n<br />\n(new scene, back at the office. JAKE is working. AMIR walks in without shirt and pants on and sits down at his chair.)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: By the way, I know what you're gonna say, but don't bother because I promised myself I'd stay humble, also, thanks for the bathroom suggestion, comprende.

(looks at jake for reaction) <br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: Amir, let's start with your script because it is by far<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (interrupting) The most viral!<br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: The longest is what I was going to say<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It reads fast<br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: It doesn't. You wanna pick your cast?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes! Okay... Jake, why don't you play Darrel McMexican <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Such an offensive name.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: He's like a rogue CIA agent with a heart of cold.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: But McMexican? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (To Emily) And Julia, why don't you play his girlfriend, Pussy Sandwich, which works since that's your actual name.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Emily. (Amir gives confused look) My name is Emily.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Right, what did I say?<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Julia and then Pussy Sandwich<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes, I think we're saying the same thing?<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: No <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Are we not? <br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: (butting in) Alright, let's just get started.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And improvise! Have fun with it! But, stick to the script. That's the most fun you can have. You know, I'm married to the script. (whispering) But I'm willing to cheat. (laughs) <br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: Okay, um... (Reading Amir's script) Interior: doesn't matter. Day. A shot of an empty room for three hours. (To Amir) We can't do that.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Well, we'll see. (winks)<br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: (reading) In stumbles our hero, Darrel McMexican. He looks just like Jake, a buff and a cool. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (reading) My heart, it's cold. I can't breathe.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (exasperated) CUT. Sorry...um, yeah. You're improvising. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: First of all, you said we could <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Which is fine, yeah<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Second of all, I'm not improvising. <br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: (coughing to get everyone's attention) (reading) As Darrel grabs his heart, not just his chest but literally he grabs his heart, his girlfriend enters. 81 years young, jet black hair, like a jet, has Pussy Sandwich for a name.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: (reading) Darrel, Darrel, Darrel McMexican, how are you? <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You're improvising a little too much for my liking , but that's fine.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: She's not improvising at all.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: (reading) It's me. Pussy, Pussy Sandwich. I'm buxom and blonde as the sun.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Awesome babe, that was so hot<br />\n<br />\n(Emily licks Murph's hand, Murph glares at Jake) <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (reading) I look at you and I want to know more about you. Are you a foodie?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Okay, okay, great. So here comes the emotional crux of the whole...piece as it were. Please, as alway's improvise, adlib, yeah, but (pounds the table to get his point across) verbatim! I can't stress that enough. Stick to the script. <br />\n<br />\nVINCENT: (reading confusedly) Pussy Sandwich let's out a high pitched queef. We can't hear it, but everyone knows it's there for sure. Dogs from around the city start sprinting to McMexican's apartment. We hear thuds, barking, pounding. These dog's wanna get in and see what's what. They know it's coming from Pussy. (incredibly confused) What they don't know is how or why. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (smiling) Wow...<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: (Murph is angrily staring back and forth at Jake and Emily. Jake is shaking his head in denial) Kiss me you fool, taste my tongue, you gaylord fool. My hair is as red as a green apple.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: (angrily at Jake) WOAH! <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (defensively) W..W...What!? Dude!<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: (irate) TASTE MY TONGUE!?!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (scared) SHE'S TALKING SHE SAID IT!<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: (interrupting) Are you REALLY talking to my girl like that!?!? Are you REALLY!?!?!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'm not talking to her at all! She was talking to me!<br />\n<br />\n(Murph throws his shirt off) <br />\n<br />\nMURPH: YOU ARE! YOU ARE! OK!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (on the verge of tears) I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THIS, AMIR WROTE THIS! <br />\n<br />\nMURPH: (to Amir) Oh yeah, what's going on here!?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: He was improvising.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I DIDN'T IMPROVISE!<br />\n<br />\n(Murph punches Jake square in the face and holds his head to the table)<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Your ass is mine McMexican! Your ass is MIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEUUUUUUAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (crying) What the fuck man! <br />\n<br />\nEND SCENE<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(Murph and Emily alone) <br />\n<br />\nMURPH: I don't know what happened back there. I just... I lost it. I love you so much.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: I love you too. <br />\n<br />\nMURPH: And I just feel like I need to work on my anger problems...<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: (interrupting) No, no, if anything (walking towards Murph and grabbing his abs) I want you to be angrier, crazier. Can you do that for me? <br />\n<br />\n(Piano starts playing) <br />\n<br />\nMURPH: (in a deep, agitated voice) Absolutely. <br />\n<br />\nLink to episode<br />\n",

Jake your booty.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Stop!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (joining Jake on couch) Hey, dude, thanks for meeting me here.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (simultaneously) Oh, bad odor!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So how do people make money today?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: That's right, creating iPad apps.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Don't think that I agreed to a meeting. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And, what better way to create iPad apps than in a meeting that both people agreed to?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok, first app idea. You know how it's hard to manage your time, like time management?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Sure.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So this is just a list of other shit that's hard to deal with.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Really? Number one says wiping. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yes.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That shouldn't be that hard.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: And yet it is.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No it's not.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (holds up iPad) Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: That's an example of something I do all the time.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I know.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What's the app?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm not always talking about apps.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok. So this app might be a dud. (snorts)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. (chuckles)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ribs.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Exactly right, how did you-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How is that not what it sounds like?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You're getting defensive.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Oh my-<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That app has been around for a while.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I feel so bad for you, man.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Fine. (gets up)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Bahh! When I'm done!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: What is that noise?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: What noise?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave. (gets up)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I guess so- Bahh!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (taps iPad) Alright.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Actually you know what? (takes iPad) I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (huggine Jake) I hate when we fight like this.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Stop!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half. (laughs briefly) What's the hardest part about reading?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Finding the time.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Ok, never mind.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Your app idea just says the vowels.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Never mind, I said!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: You try to put everything in a box. And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away. (pause, reaches for hug) I'm sorry.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Get-<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: So you know how Instagram sold for (puts pinky to lip) one billion dollars?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Don't do that.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (laughs) So this would be an app that harasses the creators of Instagram until they give us a few million dollars to stop.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Alright, don't take this as a compliment.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Thank you.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's your best app idea yet.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Appreciate it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's still terrible.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Danke.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's just all your other ideas are so bad.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Gracias. (laughs)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ok, don't take this-<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Todah rabah. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Fuck you!<br />\n<br />\n(pause, Amir recoils)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (whispers) Ouch.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh no, constructive criticism!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Quit. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (faintly) Ow.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Right, yeah, yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: That's fine, Ok.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Furthermore,<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Oh?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You're not smart.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: No.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You're not getting better.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Nope.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: With your time.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'm not sure you did.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Well, at least I tried my best, you know? (snorts)<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (tapping couch) Absolutely (snorts) I just, uh. Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You are weak.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (raising voice) Enough!

I don't commit to wearing something that makes me feel vulnerable without having an airtight excuse for every line of questioning. Does that make me insecure?

You'll look normal and you won't be as angry.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: GQ Teen says the summer look is Toms shoes, Ray Bans, board shorts, and a muscle tee.

What's my time?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah man it was really quick, but you obviously didn't finish showering.

Amir finishes distributing the meals.]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Welcome, hello, bruchim habaim, and bon giorno, to a culinary experience from all around; our globe... Carpe diem! Seize the fish. Heh! No, tonight we're having carp.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Nice.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: [imitating a record scratching] Wrickee wrickee-- scratch that. We are having branzino.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Neko's a vegan.

That would've been polite.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I--... just met her, so I wouldn't know anything about her dietary restrictions, right?<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and I kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...<br />\n<br />\n[Murph holds his hands up, his right between Emily and his left, so only Jake can see the ring he's already wearing.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: [whispering] Okay, I saw it, put it away...<br />\n<br />\n[Murph holds his right hand closer to Emily, she kisses his palm, and he lowers his hands again.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: [whispering] Good save.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Uh... it's fine. It's fine. Neko, um, do you eat beef? Or, do you not, because you're a fucking vegan now, all of a sudden-- I can't-- I'm sorry.<br />\n<br />\n[Amir walks off. Murph gets up to follow him, and shoots Jake a look of disappointment.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: That's not on me, right? ...Buddy? Okay.<br />\n<br />\n[Murph goes to talk to Amir just outside the dining room. Amir is chugging a glass of pinot grigio.]<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Hey, c'mon, c'mon. Easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: [ranting rapidly, barely retaining any semblance of composure] I just can't believe she fucking did that to me like that. And in the middle of a fucking meal? What kind of timing is that?<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: I know. It's Jake's fault. It's Jake's fault. He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, he raw-dogged me, h-- I feel like he bent me over a table and dogged me raw or something. He raw-dogged me! Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, and he did it raw! That's the worst part. I feel like if he lubed me up-- okay, fine. That's one thing. Whatever. Moist: it slides right in-- Yeah! Just spit. [makes a spitting noise] Slides right in, slides right out; it doesn't hurt that much. But for him-- for him to raw-dog us like that?<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: [simultaneously] Alright. Right; spit-- just spit on it. That's all I'm asking. Just spit-- just one. Right. That's fine.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Hey-- you guys know I can hear you, right? This was not my fault--<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: It was his fault!<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It was.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: But you're ready for this, okay? You can handle it.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\n[Murph pats Amir on the shoulder.]<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Go!<br />\n<br />\n[Back in the dining room, Emily is staring at Jake and sensually licking a piece of fish she's holding with her bare hands.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You know, that's not hot. Your hands probably smell like fish now.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: [returning to the table with Amir] Whoa ho ho! Nobody touch their dinner until I post this to Pinterest. This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week. [he leans over Jake's shoulder] Jake, you're gonna re-pin that, right?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: I'd have to sign up for an account.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Good, so you'll do that?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah. You know what? When I go home tonight, I'll sign up for an account.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: I'd feel much more comfortable if you'd just do it now.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: [whispering] Not this second, okay?<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: [whispering] Jake, don't fuckin' embarrass me at my house, dude.<br />\n<br />\n[Jake grabs his iPhone.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: It's not gonna let me do it from my phone.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Here.<br />\n<br />\n[Murph procures a green iPad from somewhere, and hands it to Jake.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: This is insane, that you're making me do this.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Don't talk to me.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Okay. I'm on Pinterest. Here, just re-pinned it.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Babe, make sure that he pins some other stuff. Otherwise it'll look like a dummy account.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: She's right... Fuck it, let's browse!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Fuck what? Dinner? The date?<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Babe, make sure that he shows his feminine side but also his masculine pride.<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Ya gots to! Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: All right! So, this is a most interesting little dish; it's sort of a palate-cleanser in terms that it's a spinach hazelnut salad with onions, olives, and a citrus balsamic vinaigrette.<br />\n<br />\n[As Amir describes the salad, Emily smiles slyly and runs her foot up Jake's leg under the table. Jake shakes his head, but Emily nods back. Jake points at Murph, who's still standing over his shoulder, and mouths He's your boyfriend, then pushes her foot back down away from him.]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I know what you're thinking: Salad in between the meals? Well, we sort of had a... special little customer who needed a special little salad, so here we are.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: Neko's allergic to nuts. [kicks Jake under the table]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Is she! Okay, Neko, how 'bout this? How 'bout you [Amir begins furiously dismantling the salad with his hands, throwing hazelnuts onto the floor] eat, around, the, nuts? How 'bout that, Neko? Huh? ...Sorry, it--<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Hey hey, focus up, I need your feedback on this pin: pink aztec dress, or cupcake kebabs? I can't pin 'em both.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Why not?<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: You don't get a say! You don't get a say.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: This is my account! These are my pins!<br />\n<br />\n[Emily uses her feet to rip Jake's shirt off and drag it under the table.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: 'Ey-- Weak!<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Oh, ho ho! I didn't realize we were poppin' shirts; I was gonna wait until after the gelato, but... you only YOLO once!<br />\n<br />\n[Murph begins undressing.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: We're not popping shirts, and that's not the phrase.<br />\n<br />\nEMILY: [also disrobing] Let's play spin the bottle.<br />\n<br />\n[Amir, having taken off his tux, begins pouring out a nearly-full bottle of wine onto the floor.]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Hey, I got the bottle!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Hey, I brought that.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm doin' you a favor, bro!<br />\n<br />\n[Everybody laughs but Jake.]<br />\n<br />\nMURPH: Ha ha ha!

      "script": "[Introduction]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You're watching Jake and Amir, but I bet you're just looking at Jake! <br />\n<br />\nJake: Wow, low self esteem. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah!<br />\n<br />\n[Jake is sitting at his desk. Amir enters, sits at his desk, clears his throat and unrolls a scroll]<br />\n<br />\nJake: Not another scroll dude <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Top 10 first date ideas: by Jacob-<br />\n<br />\nJake: No!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Penn Cooper-<br />\n<br />\nJake: No!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Hurwitz<br />\n<br />\nJake: No! Use your own name!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 10 <br />\n<br />\nJake: You sick fuck! Use you own name!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Where and when. Let it be her call, it is 2011 after all<br />\n<br />\nJake: It's actually 2012 and right off the bat first up on your top 10 date ideas is sort of a cop out so you don't have to choose one <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 9: feeling wine! laughs<br />\n<br />\nJake: Not that good of a joke <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Take her to a wine bar; and not a place that's close, go real far; and not in a plane, drive in a car. That's right, go to wine country - Napa Valley, California together. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Great! <br />\n<br />\n[While Jake is talking, Amir plays peekaboo behind the scroll]<br />\n<br />\nJake: So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy- <br />\n<br />\n[Amir still peeks from behind the scroll, this time wearing sunglasses]<br />\n<br />\nJake: Stop doing that!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 8: Take your mother on a date. The first chick you were inside of and you didn't even call her. Now that's baller. <br />\n<br />\nJake: That's disgusting <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Lucky number sleven: change your name to Kevin! <br />\n<br />\nJake: Weird. Not a date<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Meet her in heaven. That's right a Romeo and Juliet group suicide so you could spend all of eternity together. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Six: stands for chicks. That's right, it's the year 2000, so wherever she wants to go you make it happen, Cap'n. <br />\n<br />\nJake: That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot <br />\n<br />\nAmir: High five: smoke a bowl and roll. Wake and bake and make her make you a steak. You're ingesting weed and ecstasy, and guess what day it is... X-mas eve.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Have you done that before? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yes! Number 4 is a city so nice they named it Rice. Rice, Texas. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Another road trip?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You actually fly in through Dallas! It's a hub!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Fine.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 3: will you marry me? <br />\n<br />\nJake: Too much, too fast, way too soon! <br />\n<br />\nAmir: I don't need an answer tonight, but I do need a promise in writing that you'll love me forever. <br />\n<br />\nJake: That's more than an answer. That's a contract. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: All marriages are arranged, if you include destiny. <br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 2: Darlin' it's always been you. Please say I do, I have a rabbi a priest and a mosque on standby. <br />\n<br />\nJake: That last one is not a person. By the way, these are all still first date suggestions, right? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Honestly, I'm just trying to get laid. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Bad way <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number 1: you are the one <br />\n<br />\nJake: Okay <br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm down on one knee and this is my plea. You are the prettiest girl that I ever did see. So you ask that Lady: Will you marry me?<br />\n<br />\n[Both stay silent as Amir rolls up the scroll]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Well?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Well what?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Well, thoughts on the list? <br />\n<br />\nJake: Why do you do this? Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it? <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Great, so a simple yes or no would have sufficed. <br />\n<br />\nJake: It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question<br />\n<br />\nAmir: And? What are your thoughts on the list? <br />\n<br />\nJake: It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person. <br />\n<br />\nAmir: Wow! That was scoff unexpected... I honestly thought you loved it.<br />\n",

Paul is standing up, talking to them. Amir is standing and wearing a denim vest.)<br />\n<br />\nPaul: Hey everybody, thanks for coming today. Uh, the reason I wanted to have this all-hands meeting is because that there are a lot of new faces at the company, and I thought this would be a good chance to get to know each other. So why don't we go around the room, everybody say your name, what you do, and maaaybe a fun fact about yourself. I'll start. I'm Paul, I'm the CEO, and my favorite movie is Con Air.<br />\n<br />\n(Everybody sitting at the table nods in recognition. Amir starts laughing in a forced tone.)<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Heh heh heh. NOT.

Everybody Shia Labeouf is in the house, and he's ready to take the floor.<br />\n<br />\nMichael: (still introducing himself) Uh, I'm an intern--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You're a God! You're an A-list God!<br />\n<br />\nMichael: And I once ate an entire pint of Ben  Jerry's Phish Food.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You once made out with Megan Fox's box on the set of Transformers the first, you humble bitch. Brag a little! You've earned it! (Chuckling, then whisper) Shia-it.<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: Hey everyone, I'm Streeter Seidell--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You mean Streeter Pie-Fell, as in a Pie Fell, in your mouth, and you pretty much... loved it. (Chuckling)<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: Yeah right, exactly. Uh, I'm the editor in chief here--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Editor in cheese? (snort) You wish you were in cheese.<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: (Below his breath at Amir) Alright, c'mon. (Back to introduction) And uh, my favorite food--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Is everything.<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: Alright I walked right into that one.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir nods)<br />\n<br />\nJake: Uh, I'm Jake--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: This man needs no introduction, and if you don't know who he is (points to the door) get the fuck out.<br />\n<br />\n(The person sitting next to Jake stands up and walks out)<br />\n<br />\nJake: (Looking at the person walking out). Are you... C'mon.<br />\n<br />\n(Paul walks out of the room, several others follow him.)<br />\n<br />\nJake: I'm a writer here--<br />\n<br />\nAmir: You're more than that. You're a generous man, you're a kind soul, and you're engaged. A family man, everyone.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Paul just said to say what we do with the company.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, Paul also said that his favorite movie was Con Air but nobody called him out on that!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You did! Where did you get that vest?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Allow me to give Jake's interesting fact, we're in love.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I won a spelling bee in forth grade.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: And you deserve to win it in fifth.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That doesn't make any sense.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Alright, my turn.<br />\n<br />\nJake: It's actually not.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: My name is Amir Valerie Blumenfeld, I am an unpaid consultant for this company, I once killed an innocent child, and I love mini-golf. (Mimes putting the ball) It was not on purpose, but it's something that I live with, every day. (Winks)<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: Okay, what?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: That's right! I once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.<br />\n<br />\nJulie: You monster.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I am a monster. On the golf course I take no prisoners. Also I will never un-see that child's face. Every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. (Makes a scary face). Bleh.<br />\n<br />\nMichael: How could you do that?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: How could you do that? Crystal Skull? We saw that, it was garbage! I killed a child? (Amir starts crawling to where Michael is sitting across the table). Yeah, well you killed a franchise!<br />\n<br />\n(Streeter grabs Amir by his vest and pushes him against the table)<br />\n<br />\nStreeter: Hey! Hands off the beef!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Don't eat my vest. Don't eat my vest. I'm serious man do not eat my friggin vest.<br />\n",

MMMMPH!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Jesus Christ dude, what happened?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: (Singing) I had a bad day, I took-a one down, I sang a sad song just to turn it around...<br />\n<br />\nJake: Does this have anything to do with the 319 Emails I got when I got off the subway?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It's kinda hard to be sure, I was too busy being BOUND AND GAGGED FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES ON ACCOUNT OF ALL THE EMAILS I SENT!<br />\n<br />\nJake: So it's not that hard to be sure, right? First email from you came 49 minutes ago. Anybody want half a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich? I tried to finish it but could nay get 'er done. I'm full as a kite and I just might stop to eat you out.<br />\n<br />\nAmir:... EMAIL OF THE FUCKING YEAR.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Not really. You respond to your email Here ye, here ye, did anybody hear me? This is an amazing deal, get it while she's NOT. Kevin responds I'll eat the sandwich if you shut the fuck up. And you respond to that I'll shut up if literally everybody in the company tells me to... Gangam Style.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah, exactly, it's a Korean pop song.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I know.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: And guess what Kevin got in response? A heaping helpful of radio silence.<br />\n<br />\nJake: 211 emails in 30 seconds, which means a bunch of people told you to shut up twice.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: They didn't have to tell me twice.<br />\n<br />\nJake: They actually did, because you respond Yeehaw, partners! Didn't realize y'all hated me so much. Owie Zowie. But, not everyone told me to shut up twice, therefore the email thread, unlike Murph's grandmother, lives.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Low blow? HELL NO!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Hell yes. I guess people stopped responding to the thread and started talking to you in person, because your next email says, I've had it up to here with people coming by my desk and being mean to me.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't know why you guys have this mob mentality, but you sheep need to learn how to think individually.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: BAH, BAA! And guess what happened next... my neck was stapled!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yep, saw that. Your next email, Who's the coward bitch that stapled my neck? I blinked for a second and I missed you, missed you, now I gotta kissed you. Make yourself known. Rosie responds It was me. and I guess you had to retaliate in some way, because your next email is Who's the prick that threw that brick at my head when I went to hit Rosie? Be a man and fess up to the crime so that I can do the time. Owen Parsons responds It was me. And you reply, 9 minutes later, Who's the loser who tripped me when I went to staple Owen's neck?

EVER.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes, I imagine it was, because you sent out another email. (Amir is shown eating his sandwich.) I was just hit with another fucking brick. Are you shitting me with these? That makes 3 bricks on the gay. I don't know where you guys even got these things or the audacity to hurl them at me at such close range-- are you not full anymore?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah. <br />\n<br />\nJake: Why are you still typing these emails?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I wanted to diffuse the situation!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You think this is diffusing the situation? Y'all are gonna have to bind and gag me if you want peace and quiet around here. And good luck, because I'm got going quietly. Your last email, sent 30 seconds before I got here, is obviously typed with your face, it's just MMPHUSFISDMPH.

I said, please come, I legitimately burned my face this time! They show up, there's a flaming pile of dog shit on my own apartment stoop. Got 'em good.<br />\n<br />\nJake: ..did you?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Nah, not really. They just left and a huge part of my apartment burned down. Can you do me a favor?<br />\n<br />\nJake: What?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'd like to stay with you in order to recoup from this injury. I need you to be my nurse for a week.<br />\n<br />\nJake: ...no.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What? You already said yes! How could you take it back now?<br />\n<br />\nJake: No, I didn't.

This was your soup!<br />\n<br />\nJake: What are you talking about?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I made this soup for you, right? I called you last night and I said, if I brought in leftover split pea soup, would you have some?<br />\n<br />\nJake: And I said no!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Exactly! And then I said, if you're not going to have it, then I'm just not going to bring any in, and you said fine.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah, fine as in don't bring in the soup.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: No, fine as in yes!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Stop telling me what I mean by shit!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Are you actually yelling at me right now?

Go on.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I figured if I doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. Show me some tender love and care, y'know? Maybe rent some DVDs from Blockbuster Media.

I don't really like yams, but I wouldn't have the heart to tell you.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Well, I'm well aware that you hate yams.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I hate 'em.

You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I don't know what to say.  I guess I got punked.  It's just that I'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE:  Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no. You know, even, going forward, how about if you ignore my texts, I'll know, don't buy the cords.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Fine, I ignored the text.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE:  Going forward, I said.  As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!  (to the office) If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I thought you said you didn't like the pants.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You thought wrong.

It's not exactly how I went to spend my Sunday afternoon, right, bud?<br />\n<br />\n(Amir's cell phone rings)<br />\n<br />\nAMIR:  The hospital's calling me.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: And once again, you choose them over me.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I haven't picked it up yet.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah, but I know you're thinking about it, dude.  And tell you what, if you pick that up, (in a bit of an accent) me and you are done professionally.  (to the office) Another joke for everybody, that's Christian Ball [sic], (to Amir) but really? Pick it up, and we're not friends.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Fine. (to phone) Hey, can I call you back? (Amir hangs up)<br />\n<br />\n(Jake gives Amir a look.

You called yourself Daddy.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Yeah, daddy. It's a joke. It's a joking nickname. <br />\n<br />\nJAKE: No, it's not a joke.

Can I have a bite, nephew?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah, no. All of those are examples of things that are unacceptable, actually. <br />\n<br />\nAMIR: UNACCEPTABLE?! To say bro? Are you kidding me? Everyone calls each other that!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Fine. Bro may be the one that works. But calling yourself my aunt?<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (Overlapping) Stop. It doesn't. I don't need a list. All I'm saying. It doesn't have to be. Don't make it a thing. Don't make it a thing. Why are you getting so angry? Why are you harping on it like this? I'm just asking you not to call yourself daddy.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Overlapping) Bro is fine, okay. So we're on the same generational level. So why don't I give you a list? I'll give you a family tree and you give me a pre-approved list of what I can call you and what I cannot. Daddy: X. Mommy: X. Bro: Okay, that's fine. Cuz: That's fine. So everything on my generational level is fine.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: I'm angry? You're about to leave!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Yeah, I'm gonna leave. You made me uncomfortable. You made it weird.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Because it s- it was not even sexual.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (Overlapping) Wow. Really? Right now you're gonna say- Oh God. Dude, I didn't think it was. Don't make it a sexual thing.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Overlapping) I guess now it grosses you out because you think it's a sexual thing. (In a mocking sexy tone) Give Daddy a bite. Give Daddy a bite. I wasn't even saying it like-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You saying that makes it kind of a sexual thing.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Overlapping) What? Because I'm saying it's not a thing makes it a thing?

How's that going to work? (Mimic being on the phone) Oh sorry, I'm going to work from home today. Yeah. Amir called me a thing. I guess I'm freaked out and I don't want to be here anymore. If that freaks you out. If that little amount of stuff freaks you out then maybe you shouldn't be here maybe you shouldn't be at work. Because in this environment people call each other nicknames all the time!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: (Overlapping) Yes. I think I'm going to go home. I'll work-I'll work from home. I'll email everyone and say I'm working from home. Not a thing, you called yourself daddy. Shut up dude. Yeah! Maybe I will leave! I'm going to leave. You know what I'm going to do-<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: With the yelling, you can stop it right now. I'm going to go home. I've lost my appetite. You don't get the sandwich. I'm gonna throw it away. Where is it?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (With sandwich bite in mouth) I got it.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: How?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: (Still with bite and sunglasses on over glasses) I guess Daddy wins!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: You're not even chewing it.<br />\n<br />\nTHE END<br />\n<br />\nEPISODE LINK<br />\n",

You're watching Jake and Amir.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: 2011 y'all!<br />\n<br />\nJake: No.<br />\n<br />\n[intro]<br />\n<br />\n[Jake and Amir sitting at their desks, Amir starts to dose off]<br />\n<br />\nJake: Hey can you not fall asleep right now? We need to talk about that disgusting habit that you've picked up.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It's called butt chugging, and last time I checked, it wasn't disgusting.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Really? Have you checked recently? Because according to the news story that I saw, it involves sticking a funnel inside your asshole, and ingesting alcohol through your colon.<br />\n<br />\nAmir [unfolding a scroll]: Top ten wines to butt chug!<br />\n<br />\nJake [interrupting]: Where do you go scroll shopping? Did you raid an ancient pirate ship or something?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: By Amir [long bleep is heard and Amir's mouth is censored] Blumenfeld.<br />\n<br />\nJake: How about you never say that again in the office.<br />\n<br />\nAmir [reading off the scroll]: Number ten! I'll say it again. If the taste is heinous, shove it up your anus! you'll get drunk better, faster, stronger.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing \"happy new queer\".<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number nine, that's wine and dine! A Chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.<br />\n<br />\nJake: You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: To each, her own.<br />\n<br />\nNumber eight, it must be fate. A Zinfandel for this infidel make me think, don't ask, do tell. I stick a funnel in my butt.<br />\n<br />\nJake: We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm the life and death, of every party.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number seven, is Levant. That's right, I soak a full body bread in a Jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. Aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little Tic-Tacs.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah!<br />\n<br />\nJake: Why?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number six, it's for dicks! Take a Capri-Sun straw and stick it in your urethra. With a reverse piss, you can't miss.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So you graduated to dick chugging?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: With honors, sir.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number five, P. nomwar? More like p. yes. - Lar.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Woah.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Woah<br />\n<br />\nJake: Bad.<br />\n<br />\nAmir [disappointed]: Oh.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Terrible rhyme.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: No?<br />\n<br />\nJake: How did that make your final draft?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: It didn't.<br />\n<br />\nJake: This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number four. One Tequila, two Tequila, three Tequila, sore. Ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number three, you and me. Sippin' on some English tea.<br />\n<br />\nJake: So not butt chugging.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Oh, no, no, no. We're sipping it through our assholes.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Definitely not doing that with you.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number two, how about some Yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. That's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!<br />\n<br />\nJake: I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...<br />\n<br />\nAmir: No.<br />\n<br />\nJake: ...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: How is that your call to make?<br />\n<br />\nJake: I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: That's so illogical to me.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Really?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Yeah.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: \"Fuck this quack, you're a hack\", I think that's illogical.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Not fair.<br />\n<br />\nJake: That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I'm almost done with the list.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Number one, have some fun in the sun hun. Bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. Put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. Not Vodka nor Gin, no those can't go in. Spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. You're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. Which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? Not red nor white, nor Captain Morgan's Delight, no. What will save the day? Oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.<br />\n<br />\nJake: No.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: A simple Rose.<br />\n<br />\n[Jake start clapping slowly]<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Thank you.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Not 'till I celebrate, [takes out a glass of blended fish and alcohol, and a funnel], with a number nine.<br />\n<br />\nJake: Please not now, not here at the office.<br />\n<br />\n[Amir starts pouring the drink into the funnel, and looks in pain].<br />\n<br />\nJake: Oh no! Ah!<br />\n<br />\nAmir [in pain]: Ah! It's in me.<br />\n",

I say we go down there, and try to defuse it!<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Great idea, but... pretty cold down there. You sure the reactor's not indoors somewhere?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: It's not indoors!

You should go in and check it out.<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Aaah, no.

Amir is walking and videotaping his face.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: [off-screen] Okay, we have to get back to my apartment, now.<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: That was epic, man. I totally recorded it-- Oh, shit...<br />\n<br />\n[Diamond-wipe to Jake, soaking wet and wrapped up in a blanket in his apartment.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Did you get it?<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: Uhh, well, good news and bad news, heh: Good news is, you get to jump in the river again! Yay! That was... fun. The bad news is, due to a camera malfunction, the, um... the footage was sort of lost. Not human error--<br />\n<br />\n[Jake begins slapping Amir over and over.]<br />\n<br />\nAMIR: N-- ow! Stop-- high-fiving my-- face!<br />\n<br />\n[Cut.

Either that, or I'll do you one better!<br />\n<br />\n[Amir begins running.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: Ey-- no. No!<br />\n<br />\n[Cut to footage from earlier. Jake is naked with a belt around his neck. There is a censor bar. There is obnoxiously-inserted text throughout.]<br />\n<br />\nJAKE: [to the dog] Hey. Go away.

Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten to work, set up the entire hookah, and <br />\nthen waited for me to get here so you could ask me to smoke with you.<br />\n<br />\n(Amir moves his mouth as if he's blowing smoke rings)<br />\n<br />\nJake: Nothing's coming out of your mouth so you're definitely not blowing smoke rings.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Don't blow smoke up my ass.<br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't think that's lit, man.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: I have strawberry.

Hm? Why is riding on a motorcyle cool? Why is wearing SPF of less than 10 at the beach cool?<br />\n<br />\nJake: I don't that think that is cool.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Because it's dangerous!

Because you shouldn't try to be cool! You should just be yourself and not care what other people think?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Yes.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: No! No, absolutely not! Last week, I paid 2000 dollars for a getting-with-chicks seminar. And guess what happened: final exam <br />\ntime rolls around and we're at a bar, and every single one of us hooks up with a girl. That's right: we all made out like bandits. And <br />\non my way home, guess what I saw: the teacher of the class, Sean, he was discreetly paying every single girl that made out with us <br />\nnerds money. And you know why?<br />\n<br />\nJake: Because he hired whores to french you so you'd feel better about yourself!<br />\n<br />\nAmir: Because I'm cool!<br />\n<br />\nJake: You know, with two grand you probably could have paid girls to do a lot more than just make out with you.<br />\n<br />\nAmir: What.<br />\n",

For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change.

This year I filled out a March Madness packet! 100 different permutations, each one representing every single possible outcome!<br />\r\nJake: There are 68 games, there are way more than 100 possible outcomes.<br />\r\nAmir: Fook me, huh? No, Fook Duke!<br />\r\nJake: I didn't say fook you.<br />\r\nAmir: It's a joke, Jake, okay? I can't set it up and knock it down, just play along for once! God damn it!<br />\r\nAmir: Who do you have as your write-in candidate?<br />\r\nJake: There is no write-in candidate.<br />\r\nAmir: Exactly right. It was a trick question.<br />\r\nJake: You have Mickey Mouse in your Final Four.<br />\r\nAmir: Trick question I said! As in he's a tricky little mouse bitch who can scamper his way past the Elite Eight. I'm not saying I'm proud of the little rat diva but I can say I can see him doing it! Also, don't look at my sheet! Look at my sheet, that's a cheat! Thats a DQ!<br />\r\nJake: Hey! Stop it!<br />\r\nAmir: Minnesota, huh? How about a mini soda?<br />\r\n(Raises small Coke)<br />\r\nAmir: Is there a size Coke that would have made you laugh?<br />\r\nJake: No it's just that you've filled out--<br />\r\nAmir: Ole Miss! Donald. Bet the farm. E-i-e-i. No!<br />\r\nJake: When do you do this?<br />\r\nAmir: What?<br />\r\nJake: When do you come up with these shitty rhymes?<br />\r\nAmir: It's not even a \"my jokes are bad\" thing, I know you think it's that way, but that mini soda thing crushed yesterday at my cousin's brit.<br />\r\nJake: Ew!<br />\r\nAmir: I really think that the diva mouse can take it this year, this crazy little shifty mouse.<br />\r\nJake: I know that's what you think.<br />\r\nAmir: No, I'm serious! I mean, he's got a snowball's chance in hell, sure, but in this tournament that's all you need. I mean, who had 'Nova topping Georgetown in '85, nobody.<br />\r\nJake: People had it. I mean, it was a long shot, but at least it was a basketball team.<br />\r\nAmir: Fuckin' asshole.<br />\r\nJake: What?! What did you just say? Say it again.<br />\r\nAmir: Butler University. Hey Jake, the butler did it! They're Final Four bound. And gagged!<br />\r\nJake: You crossed them out.<br />\r\nAmir: What?<br />\r\nJake: You don't have Butler, you crossed them out. That's where you wrote Mickey Mouse.<br />\r\nAmir: That tricky mouse fink is up to tricks! I didn't cross them out, you gotta believe me. Do you believe me?<br />\r\nJake: No!<br />\r\nAmir: This year's Cinderella story? It's gonna be me! I'm gonna wear a gown to the Final Four and sit on a pumpkin instead of a seat.<br />\r\nWhat's the opposite of a Prince Charming, you ask. How about a Dunce Harming?<br />\r\nJake: Not quite buddy. A dunce, a prince, not quite.<br />\r\nAmir: Yeah, I know it's not quite there, I was just hoping you weren't listening.<br />\r\nJake: You talk, hoping I'm not listening?<br />\r\nAmir: Oh, Syracuse winning it all, huh? Bold!<br />\r\nJake: You don't like that pick?<br />\r\nAmir: No, I love that pick. Especially because it's 2003, right? Carmelo's still playing basketball? We just killed Saddam Hussein, so that's a positive.<br />\r\nJake: I get it.<br />\r\nAmir: What?<br />\r\nJake: I get it!<br />\r\nAmir: So, George gets a town, Louis gets a ville, and what does little ol' Amir get? Nothing but a public urination ticket and a slap on the wrist. That's not fair.<br />\r\nJake: What?<br />\r\nAmir: Whoah, great news! In your world, iTunes just launched, that's a great investment opportunity!<br />\r\nJake: I'll change the pick!<br />\r\nAmir: Why would you? I'm sure the Governator, you know Arnold Schwarzenegger, the new governor of California would endorse your pick, especially if he just got finished watching Finding Nemo, the new Pixar flick that just came out!<br />\r\nJake: How do you know so much about 2003?!<br />\r\nAmir: How do you know so little about basketball?!<br />\r\nJake: You still have MICKEY MOUSE winning it all!<br />\r\nAmir: That's because he's a diva little mousey bitch!",

I think you got into the idea of owning fur after some weird conversation you had with your cousin Leron or some strange show you saw on TV. You became fur-obsessed, going on a morbid spending spree. And when you ran out of acceptable animals to wear on your body, your blood-thirsty raid took you to the deep, dark corners of the animal wear/ware kingdom, like that pocket iguana or your rat wallet.

Maybe I can join you in your ivory tower for just a couple minutes, and that'll help me cool off. Or I can hop upon your high horse, and we can go for a ride! You know what? I got this idea from having a conversation with my cousin Leron, not from a \"television show,\" as you astutely observed.<br />\r\nJake: You know, I also said that. That was my first guess.<br />\r\nAmir: Secondly, yeah! I became fur-obsessed! You know, it's my nature to take things too far; some people love me for that.<br />\r\nJake: Nobody loves you.. for anything.<br />\r\nAmir: (pretend stabs heart) OH!<br />\r\nJake: No, that did hurt you; I know it.<br />\r\nAmir: A little bit, yes, because I didn't think you'd get that personal.<br />\r\nJake: Just move on.<br />\r\nAmir: I became blood-hungry! Sure, who wouldn't? And who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? Obviously, animals can't... (laughs) talk! But this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy. I don't know if you've ever seen an iguana cry before, but I know for a fact that I have.<br />\r\nJake: Can you stop talking about strangling the iguana?<br />\r\nAmir: And as for your last point, I think I will go home as this has turned into a public shaming of me!

I don't know if I can make it, man. [scoffs] Like, the finish line is in sight... but I'm not right. [laughs] What time is it? Four AM? Five AM? 4:05 AM?<br />\r\nJAKE: 7:45 PM, the All-Nighter starts in another fifteen minutes, and it goes for twelve hours.<br />\r\nAMIR: Stop hounding my shit, please, okay? I'm pissed, I'm scared, I'm tired, I'm... there...<br />\r\nJAKE: What? Where?<br />\r\nAMIR: There.<br />\r\nJAKE: How are you this tired already?<br />\r\nAMIR: [laughs] I'm glad you asked.<br />\r\n[Amir falls asleep immediately.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Dude, wake up!<br />\r\n[There is an ethereal transition accompanied by a harp sound. Jake and Amir are now both female, and appear to be Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer from Broad City. Amir wakes up.]<br />\r\nILANA-AMIR: Holy guac! That nap was more than legit: it was dec'!<br />\r\nABBI-JAKE: I think that might make it less than legit.<br />\r\nILANA-AMIR: Don't nitpick my twitpic, ya shit-dick! Now that wit was quite quick.<br />\r\nABBI-JAKE: Do you want me to get you some coffee? Maybe that would wake you up?<br />\r\nILANA-AMIR: I'm clearly awake if I'm talking to you, Scooby-frickin'-Don't.<br />\r\nABBI-JAKE: What are you even talking about?<br />\r\nILANA-AMIR: Bad Scooby? Nah. Bad Doo.<br />\r\n[Ilana-Amir begins laughing and then falls asleep.]<br />\r\n[Another transition and harp sound later, Amir and Jake are Brian McElhaney and Nick Kocher from BriTANick.]<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: [still laughing] Dude, you gotta crack up at that shit! That Scooby-Doo pun? That destroyed at my pop-pop's wake.<br />\r\nNICK-JAKE: Why did you tell it there?<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: Um, 'cause everyone was sad? Especially me! I was his closest friend! Open casket? Now I can't buy a basket.<br />\r\nNICK-JAKE: Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: You just did it!<br />\r\nNICK-JAKE: That was unintentional.<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: Oh, an unintentional rhyme? Well I'm an unconventional mime, [he moves his hands as if in an invisible box] eating an unpresentable lime.<br />\r\n[Brian-Amir pantomimes taking a bite out of an invisible lime.]<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: Eww!-- Fuck you. Crack up at that.<br />\r\nNICK-JAKE: Wh-- you didn't even give me time to laugh at that! You knew that would fail.<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: Fuck you, fuck you, I'm cool, and fuck you.<br />\r\n[Brian-Amir begins laughing.]<br />\r\nBRIAN-AMIR: Ohh! Oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...<br />\r\n[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are Andrew and Evan Gregory of the Gregory Brothers.]<br />\r\nEVAN-AMIR: ...And fuck you.<br />\r\nANDREW-JAKE: I-- I think we should ask Sam if you can go home.<br />\r\nEVAN-AMIR: Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?<br />\r\nANDREW-JAKE: Yes, I would.<br />\r\nEVAN-AMIR: Wow. The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.<br />\r\nANDREW-JAKE: ...What?<br />\r\n[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are themselves; Amir seems to be talking in his sleep.]<br />\r\nAMIR: I said \"You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite.\"<br />\r\n[Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew and Evan have gathered around Jake's chair.]<br />\r\nNICK: What did he just say?<br />\r\nJAKE: He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean \"what did he just say\"? It doesn't matter.<br />\r\nABBI: Oh, it doesn't matter because what? What, because he's a Jew?<br />\r\n[Abbi shoves Jake.]<br />\r\nJAKE: I didn't say that! What are you talking about?<br />\r\nAMIR: [now very much awake] I'm talkin' about you hating Jew.<br />\r\nILANA: You prick! I know many Jews.<br />\r\nJAKE: So do I! I'm half Jewish--<br />\r\n[Brian punches Jake in the face.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Ow!<br />\r\nBRIAN: I don't hit like a Jew, do I?<br />\r\nJAKE: ...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!<br />\r\nAMIR: Get him!<br />\r\nJAKE: What are you talking about--<br />\r\n[Everybody begins beating up Jake.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Hey! Ow! Ow, quit it--<br />\r\n[Amir laughs maniacally.]<br />\r\n[Harp and transition. Amir is lying on a couch, presumably dreaming the situation just shown. He is laughing in his sleep. Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew, Evan and Jake are standing around him.]<br />\r\nANDREW: I thought you said we were gonna shoot a video.<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm sorry; I think he fell asleep, so...<br />\r\nAMIR: [mumbling] Tear his... Jew-hating face off.<br />\r\nEND",

I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!<br />\r\nJAKE: That's actually really smart--<br />\r\nAMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis!

I'd love to eat a weed.<br />\r\n[Amir is slumped down on the couch, holding the bloodstained tissue.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Want to take a break?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, great idea.

Amir goes to take a sip of his apple juice, but notices the intensely awkward silence and makes a face defensively. Jake and Streeter avert their eyes from Amir and each other.]<br />\r\nAMIR: [now speaking very quietly, almost under his breath] How is that any... different...<br />\r\n[Streeter stares down at the table in silence. Jake quietly spits out the food he was chewing onto the plate in disgust. Amir scoffs.]<br />\r\nAMIR: [still quietly] Oh my God...<br />\r\n[Jake stares daggers at Amir. Streeter puts down the sandwich he had been eating for lunch. He folds his glasses up and buries his head in his hands.]<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Yeah? You can't--<br />\r\n[Streeter shakes his head. Amir scoffs again.]<br />\r\nAMIR: [quietly] ...What?<br />\r\n[Amir makes a gun shape with his hand, points it at his head, and pantomimes shooting himself. Jake nods and mouths \"do it\". Amir looks dejected, and halfheartedly attempts to chuckle. Streeter is still sitting in silence, and Jake pats Streeter's shoulder to console him. Amir attempts to do the same, but Streeter swats his hand away and then gets up and leaves. Amir and Jake are left at the table together.]<br />\r\nAMIR: [quietly] You think that's... appropriate?<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Boiling hot spum\"?<br />\r\nEND",

I'm devastated! \"Number nine: laying supine! You're flat on the floor, calling your mother a whore through a more-than-locked door!

I don't mean to get rambly, but why don't you just have a barbecue with your fambly?\"<br />\r\nJAKE: Fine. You know what? That one's nice. Stop reading the list. I responded to one; I'll follow it--<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number seven: whoa, have a nice time in Heaven! You thought that burger was bison? Nah. That burger was ricin!

Yeah!'\"<br />\r\nJAKE: You depraved lunatic! Okay, you're talking about calling an ambulance in front of your dying family, and then not giving the EMT team the directions to your house?

I don't want your death penalty, Your Honor! It was a simple mistake!

I don't wanna do this chore!'\"<br />\r\nJAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number three:\"<br />\r\nJAKE: Holy shit...<br />\r\nAMIR: \"...fireworks for me!

OK, you are 30 years old. People are married with kids at your age and you are crying, okay? You-- you don't wear the best clothes, by the way. You are currently wearing a pair of khakis that you shit in over a year ago!<br />\r\nAMIR: It was J-Crew!<br />\r\nJAKE: Wash them!<br />\r\nAMIR: I am serious dude! I honestly feel like god owes me money at this point for dealing me more than a shit hand. And I am not talking about being paid back karmically, like with a good career opportunity, or a love interest. I am talking about Him! Owing me! Cash!<br />\r\nJAKE: You self-centered piece of shit.<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\r\nJAKE: Prick.<br />\r\nAMIR: Watch out.<br />\r\nJAKE: You are a microscopic fleck of dirt, dude!<br />\r\nAMIR makes a \"wow\" expression.<br />\r\nJAKE: You are awful, you are an awful ugly person.<br />\r\nAMIR: Agreed. With two buck teeth and no ears!<br />\r\nJAKE: You have ears.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, bullshit, you are just trying to make me feel better.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, I am not talking about your physical appearance, I am saying your attitude is so negative that it makes you an ugly person.<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, I agree! Also, I have not one, not two, but one infected nipple ring!<br />\r\nJAKE: What if I just told you that you have swag? Would you stop talking then?<br />\r\nAMIR: No, because at this point, I feel like you'd just say it to shut me up and it wouldn't mean anything because you didn't say it originally!<br />\r\nJAKE: You have swag.<br />\r\nSilence. AMIR tries to start a sentence, multiple times.<br />\r\nAMIR: For real?<br />\r\nJAKE: Yah.<br />\r\nAMIR: Yah.<br />\r\nAMIR wears sunglasses.<br />\r\nAMIR: Thank you. Actually, that means a lot coming from you, believe it or not I, uh, (smirks) I don't know, I'm kind of weirdly obsessed with you I guess...hah, so for you to say something like that to me, I don't know--<br />\r\nJAKE: Cool. It's fine.<br />\r\nAMIR: I like it, I guess.<br />\r\nJAKE: Quiet.<br />\r\nAMIR: I appreciate it.<br />\r\nJAKE: You are welcome.<br />\r\nAMIR: (singing in the melody of \"I got you, babe\") cause I got swag<br />\r\nJAKE: A few seconds ago-- (silence) what the fuck was that?<br />\r\nAMIR: It was a stupid, stupid song.<br />\r\nJAKE: Go ahead and finish it. I'd love to see this, yeah.<br />\r\nAMIR: I made a dumb, cause I thought you'd cut it off, there's no end to it, it's just-- it's like, uh-- I barely wrote it. It's basically like, uh, this and that. The tune is-- I can't do the tune now, because I'm like... about to cry, but the lyrics were the weakest link, they were-- it's so dumb, why do you make me do this? It's hard to say without the tune, which is actually, pretty tight, but I can't do that because I am sad as shit. It was (attempts to sing) I got swag... I got swag... Tell the world that--<br />\r\nJAKE: Does it feel like you have swag?<br />\r\nAMIR: It actually feels like a, uh, burning sensation in my chestal area! (lifts shirt)<br />\r\nJAKE: That's an infected nipple!<br />\r\nAMIR: Hashtag swag!",

You said you were a political activist rising up against this see something, say nothing bull sheeite. A mix between Che Guevara, Bam Margera, and Dom Irrera. And then you said \"I'm part of the sixty-nine percent.\" And when nobody laughed, you started crying.<br />\r\nAMIR: Do you know what that means? I feel like if you knew what that meant, the sixty-nine thing, you'd be cracking up.<br />\r\nJAKE: I know what that is.<br />\r\nAMIR: Not the number, ass. It's a sex thing.

I knew you'd give a fricken' one word answer and I knew you'd say fine, and to prove it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper before I left my apartment this morning.

Yeah, Shia the frickin' Beef, in the flesh! You're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker! [begins counting down on his fingers for emphasis] Film star! Movie star! TV star! And guess what? [makes a popping sound with his mouth] He's got an Instagram!<br />\r\nJAKE: Does he really?<br />\r\nAMIR: Not yet, but you're looking at a social media team, [gestures to Mike and himself] and you'd better believe that's top-notch number-one priority.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know you have an actual job here, right?<br />\r\nAMIR: Not for long!<br />\r\nJAKE: You're probably right-- also, how does having an Instagram make him a quadruple-threat?<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now!

This is Shia the fuckin' Beef!<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this.

We don't have to use alii. We're friends here, and Shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? I can smell Megan Fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what?

I have such a crush on her.<br />\r\nJAKE: This is so inappropriate for work!<br />\r\nAMIR: Wow, Jake's never been to Hollywood, Nollywood, nor Bollywood.

And I'll help him work; in fact, I want to be your Johnny Drama and your Turtle. If there's anything you need, I'm your man. I might be a vegetarian, but tonight...

Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a \"frat\"? Okay? It's a fraternity. Would you call your country a cunt?<br />\r\nAMIR: My country's a cunt.<br />\r\nJAKE: Traitor!<br />\r\nAMIR: You called it a frat first!<br />\r\nJAKE: Did I? Did I for real though?

Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.<br />\r\nAMIR: So what did you have to do?<br />\r\nJAKE: Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget. [chuckles] I also ate six banana peels--<br />\r\nAMIR: Jesus! Why?<br />\r\nJAKE: Because I'm not allowed to question why! Because our bond is tighter than the glue they used to seal my asshole shut before our Triple Chili Challenge. Okay?

And that was very foul.<br />\r\nAMIR: It'll save you time and money, let alone effort, and... did I mention c-c-c-c-c-c-cash?<br />\r\nJAKE: You did when you said \"money\".<br />\r\nAMIR: Every time I fly, when I land, I'll pen a little complaint to the airline that flew me. You know, I'll come up with something like, uh, \"oh, they denied me a drink\", \"oh, the food wasn't vegetarian\"-- whatever miscellaneous hogwash pot-pourri comes to my crazy brain-- and like clockwork, within a business day, they're reimbursing me with a fifty-dollar voucher, a hundred-dollar voucher.

A-- a \"thank you\" would have sufficed, for saving you time, money, effort, and let alone c-c-c-c-cash!<br />\r\nJAKE: How does it save me time or effort? It costs both of those things, and you know, for most people this involves overcoming some kind of moral obstacle.<br />\r\nAMIR: Well I'm not most peoples!<br />\r\nJAKE: You say that like it's a good thing; it's a very bad thing. Alright? You're endangering people's jobs.<br />\r\nAMIR: Enda-- no, more than endangering! I've actually taken a pilot's wings before. I mean he wasn't fired, as it were, but he was definitely forced into an early retirement! I'm actually locked into litigation right now, so I can't speak with too much more detail about what's going on. [chuckles]<br />\r\nJAKE: What's going on?<br />\r\nAMIR: We're nine months deep and I do not have the capital to sustain this frickin' Law & Order: SV-Fuck-U! I have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and I'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point! [laughing] I actually broke twice! Yeah, I couldn't even keep a straight face. My own lawyer left the courtroom mid-testimony.<br />\r\nJAKE: Jesus!<br />\r\nAMIR: It is a shit-show! I'm so heavy in debt, but nobody wants to take this on pro-bueno! Seriously, I'm two million in the hole, and at this point I have to win the frickin' case just to break even! How is that normal? How is that fair?<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what? It's fair because it's all your fault! You did this to yourself; you're-- ...dude, you're robbing airlines!<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, they rob us.<br />\r\nJAKE: No.<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't. Please.<br />\r\nAMIR: No, have you-- have you seen these fares? They're gouging us!<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't turn this into some kind of noble cause, okay?

She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees. You, sir, are no Erin Brokovich.<br />\r\nAMIR: [finishing his thought undeterred] Well I'm Erin Choke-a-bitch!<br />\r\n[Jake stares at Amir.

Amir reflexively punches back, and connects with Jake's face.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Aaah! Ass!<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm sorry!<br />\r\n[Jake winds up and hits Amir in the jaw. Amir swings his foot around to connect with Jake's leg. Amir also punches Jake, but still seems shocked at his own actions. Jake punches Amir in the face. Jake punches Amir in the face again. Jake punches Amir in the face a third time. Jake winds up a final time and hits Amir in the throat.

Wait-- you're not still recording, are you? ...Noooo!<br />\r\n[Various CollegeHumor employees, Jake and Amir included, are gathered in a group, watching Will consume a plate of human feces.]<br />\r\nWILL: And there you have it! Three pounds of human shit in two minutes.<br />\r\n[Everybody but Jake claps. Will takes a bow and rejoins the spectators.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Boo! Boo, right? Is that not a \"boo\"?<br />\r\n[Streeter steps up.]<br />\r\nSTREETER: Alright, let's keep it going for Will! Hey-- that's what I call a shit-eatin' grin!<br />\r\n[Everybody but Jake laughs.]<br />\r\nWILL: It's true!<br />\r\nSTREETER: Alright, next up, we have... Amir!<br />\r\n[Amir steps up and shakes Streeter's hand. There is sparse clapping.]<br />\r\nAMIR: Ahh, thank you Streeter! Please don't eat me!<br />\r\nSTREETER: [laughs] Nice! Nice.<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Nice\"? You mean \"rice\", or so you wish!<br />\r\n[Streeter yanks his hand away.]<br />\r\nSTREETER: [quietly] Come on.<br />\r\n[Streeter rejoins the spectators.]<br />\r\nAMIR: So! [chuckles, waves] The name's Amir, but you can call me Jake--<br />\r\nJAKE: Please don't.<br />\r\nAMIR: --and, uh... who here has a guess as to what my talent is?<br />\r\n[Amir's coworkers begin yelling at him.]<br />\r\nCOWORKER 1: Kill yourself!<br />\r\nAMIR: No. Okay!<br />\r\nCOWORKER 2: Leave.<br />\r\nAMIR: Stop that.<br />\r\nCOWORKER 3: Boo! Boo. You suck.<br />\r\nAMIR: Jake? Help?<br />\r\nJAKE: Guys, I know Amir gets on everybody's nerves, okay, but... he's up there trying to share a talent with us, so... that takes some level of courage, I guess. Let's just give him our respect--<br />\r\nAMIR: My talent is slam poetry, and my passion is sticking it to South America.<br />\r\nJAKE: Nope. They're right. Boo. Leave.<br />\r\n[Amir holds up his construction-paper cards.]<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Uruguay: you are a gay.\"<br />\r\nJAKE: Awful. Mean-spirited, small-minded, homophobic, hateful, slanderous, thoughtless, careless--<br />\r\nAMIR: \"P--\" okay-- \"Peru: P.U.\" [waves his hand in front of his nose] And, uh, \"Brazil: you can--\" [flips cards] \"--go to hil.\" ...\"go to hell.\" Okay, feel free to not hold your applause to the end.<br />\r\nJAKE: They're not doing that.<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Nicaragua: I need more agua.\" ...So.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know that's Central America, not South.<br />\r\nAMIR: It's south of America, and I urge you to stay silent until I'm done.<br />\r\nJAKE: You just urged everyone else to applaud.<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Jamaica, mon: how 'bout you make a mon? Or are you too high?\"<br />\r\nCOWORKER 4: Get off the stage, nerd.<br />\r\nAMIR: How is this fair? Okay? I was the one making fun of other people, and now, like-- they're making fun of me!<br />\r\nJAKE: I think that's, like, the definition of \"fair\", buddy.<br />\r\nAMIR: I have several more, each one funnier than the last, but just by a show of hands, who wants me to stop?<br />\r\n[Everybody raises their hand.]<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay, who wants me to stop, but sort of sees that there's potential in this idea, and with a mentor and a page-two rewrite, can actually win this frickin' talent show?<br />\r\n[Everybody lowers their hand.]<br />\r\nAMIR: Sheep! You guys are all sheep! [pointing at coworkers] Moo, moo...<br />\r\n[Streeter comes up to escort Amir away.]<br />\r\nAMIR: ...and especially moo.<br />\r\nSTREETER: Ok-- Alright. [shoves Amir away] Okay! Well, that was awkward. So, if there's, uh, no other talents, then I think we can declare a winn-<br />\r\n[Jake steps up.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Sorry, \"no other talents\"? [laughs] Your winner's right here, 'cause J-Witz knows how to beatbox!<br />\r\n[Jake begins a beatboxing performance that consists mostly of motorboat noises and strained breathing sounds. Streeter dances along in support, but nobody else enjoys it.]<br />\r\nEVERYBODY: Boo! Boo!<br />\r\nJAKE: Okay, that's it! Will, a pound of your shit. Right now. Get it over here.<br />\r\nWILL: Yes, sir!",

Don't make me regret traveling with you.<br />\r\nJAKE: I regret it. And you know, by the way, we're not actually traveling together. I went on a work trip, and when I got to the airport I went to baggage claim and you came out inside my duffel bag. Coiled up in there with two dislocated shoulders, nearly frozen to death. You whispered, \"Surprise. Help me. Help me.\"<br />\r\nAMIR: Alright man, you said something nice I appreciate it, now stop talking before you ruin it.<br />\r\nJAKE: What did I say that was nice?<br />\r\nAMIR: Let's just go to bed okay? Lights out.<br />\r\nAMIR flicks off the light switch, and the episode is in pitch darkness until the very end. The only dialogue is a voice-over.<br />\r\nAMIR: Aah.<br />\r\nJAKE: You okay?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah. Just, uh, it's just dark as shit. Trying to find the bed.<br />\r\nJAKE: Turn on the light.<br />\r\nAMIR (After a think sound): Awwh!<br />\r\nJAKE: Turn on the light!<br />\r\nAMIR: And give up! You'd love to see that!<br />\r\nJAKE: I'll just turn on my light.<br />\r\nAMIR: No no no no no no no, I can do this!<br />\r\nJAKE: Pretty sad actually, that you're viewing this as a challenge.<br />\r\nAMIR: Either way, challenge accepted, and completed! 'Cause I just found the bed.<br />\r\nJAKE: Did you think you were pulling the metal faucet of a bed?<br />\r\nAMIR: Har har HARDLY. Which is why I'm about to turn it off! Aah! It's hot!<br />\r\nJAKE: Why are you in it?<br />\r\nAMIR: I thought I had to walk through it to get to the bedroom!<br />\r\nJAKE: Just turn on the light!<br />\r\nAMIR: Why? Why, so you could say I told you so?<br />\r\nJAKE: So we can go to bed, you idiot.<br />\r\nAMIR: We CAN go to bed. You're the idiot, 'cause I just found it, and to prove it, I'm gonna fall backwards into it, right now.<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't do this.<br />\r\nLoud thunk and farting noise<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, god. Bud? Bud? Bud!<br />\r\nAMIR: grunting<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh my god, you sound like a different person.<br />\r\nAMIR: Missed the bed by a quarter foot. Worry not, crawling into her right now.<br />\r\nJAKE: My bed. This is my bed, get out, you're wet.<br />\r\nAMIR: Here we go.<br />\r\nJAKE: Why are you opening a drawer?<br />\r\nAMIR: Just getting my bearings straight, loser! Arrivederci!<br />\r\nGlass crashing<br />\r\nAMIR: Wow, my hand sucks now.<br />\r\nJAKE: Are you okay?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes sir, just a close call. Worry not. Here we go, leaping into bed, one time.<br />\r\nAMIR apparently crashes through a window, lets out a scream, then makes a car crash causing the siren to go off, all while a lady is screaming. The sound of Amir running back up the stairs and knocking on the door is heard. The lights go back on now, we see AMIR in his underwear holding a cat. He's wet and has a bloody mouth.<br />\r\nAMIR: Room service?<br />\r\nJAKE: Ass.<br />\r\nAMIR: No.",

This is fun. Just two best friends watching hotel television together. [chuckles] We both cherish this shit.<br />\r\nJAKE: Nope.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh my God, congratulations!

Traveling with you is such a bore. What do you do, just sit inside of your room and jerk off all day? [pauses, shrugs, then pulls out his iPhone and moves his hand toward his pants]<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? [grabs the iPhone]<br />\r\nAMIR: So we can't even spank it?<br />\r\nAMIR: Can I hold the remote now?<br />\r\nJAKE: You can't hold the remote, because last time you did, you ate one of the batteries.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, here we go, it's story time! Hey children, gather 'round; it's time for Jake to tell us a tall tale! Please, Jake, remind me what happened next!<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what? I will remind you, because you were blackout drunk! You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, \"I'll take that free ride to the ER now!\"<br />\r\n[Amir flips the bird with both hands.]<br />\r\nAMIR: [on the phone] Hey, room service? Yes, can I get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? That's right: go fuck yourself! You've just been Punk'd by Ashton Coutchard! Ha, I wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!<br />\r\nJAKE: You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, bullshit. They did say 228, but I guarantee that's a lucky guess. [on the phone] Yup. Jake Hurwitz speaking.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.<br />\r\nAMIR: It's electric!<br />\r\nJAKE: That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.<br />\r\nAMIR: Boogie-woogie-woogie.

Yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. Anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. Do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? Maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? Like, just shove it up your goddamn ass? [laughs] That's right! My name is Jacob Penn Cooper Valerie Blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a Jerky-Boys-style stunt, AKA a flash mob!<br />\r\n[Amir has his butt up in the air.

No no no, I'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. That was my brother. He's going through these-- I actually am calling to apologize. He's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. We actually-- I know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. I feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, I really w-- I'll make it worth your while. I'll pay you 200 percent. [pause] Gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. I so-- I so, so much appreciate it. [Jake buries his face in a pillow] I don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! That you can shove up your goddamn ass! [laughs] Hello? Hel-- oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! That's like the third time they hung up on me!<br />\r\n[There's a loud knock.]<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh my God, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.<br />\r\nAMIR: [off screen, crying] Please, please, please! I'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! You really- I don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! You really cannot kick me out! I deserve to stay here! You don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--<br />\r\nJAKE: Just apologize!<br />\r\nAMIR: [still crying] I'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!<br />\r\nAMIR: [still crying] Got 'em.<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Got 'em\"? Really?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\r\nJAKE: You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.<br />\r\nAMIR: [on the phone, still crying] Hello, room service?

Salut.<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.<br />\r\nAMIR: Sorry... what?<br />\r\nJAKE: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, haha! Sorry.<br />\r\nJAKE: It's not a good thing, so. Right?<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?<br />\r\nJAKE: It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented \"How is this Earth, and how is this porn.\"<br />\r\nAMIR: Good question.<br />\r\nJAKE (Still reading from Amir's comment): \"If you wanna blow your nut hair back, check my imgur account\" and then the link is a picture of you photoshopped, poorly by the way...<br />\r\nAMIR: No.<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?<br />\r\nAMIR: It's subversive!<br />\r\nJAKE: It's definitely not!<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm sorry. I had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?<br />\r\nAMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): Yeah, how long have we known each other that you weren't gonna, yeah, you weren't gonna come out to me? Come on, I'm your best friend, tell me that you're a diva.<br />\r\nJAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): Really? Really? That's how you wanna play this? That's how you're gonna do this? Everybody who thinks you're an asshole?<br />\r\nJAKE: Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn?

My way or the highway!<br />\r\nJAKE: Fred Durst?<br />\r\nAMIR: Exactly right.<br />\r\nJAKE: You're a loser, man.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, really?<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah.<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? Went dickless for Michael Chiklis. So. I don't know.<br />\r\nJAKE: Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads \"Saw every Michael Chiklis movie\" text on the bottom reads \"Went dickless for him.\" You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm a good guy greg.<br />\r\nJAKE: You're absolutely not.<br />\r\nAMIR: I am, I am a good guy greg.<br />\r\nJAKE: You're a scumbag steve.<br />\r\nAMIR (Way too angry): Shut the FUCK up!

Take it back!<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.<br />\r\nAMIR: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.<br />\r\nJAKE: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote \"OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die.\"<br />\r\nAMIR: To which I zung'd him back!<br />\r\nJAKE: You wrote \"How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes.\"<br />\r\nAMIR: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.<br />\r\nJAKE: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.<br />\r\nAMIR: And counting!<br />\r\nJAKE: You commented on his post \"I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime.\" Did you even set up an AMA for that?<br />\r\nAMIR: Didn't need to.<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!<br />\r\nAMIR: You know what, enough. Okay? I already regret even bringing up the fact that I was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, I don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! I really don't!<br />\r\nJAKE: If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says \"If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself.\"<br />\r\nAMIR: And?<br />\r\nJAKE: Got a hundred and fifty.<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes.<br />\r\nJAKE: Thousand.

You were clubbed in a van by a guy named Parm.<br />\r\nAMIR: I shoot awake mid surgery, you know I guess the club (lifting leg again) didn't do the trick.

No! Enough is enough! I take a scalpel, blind old Parm and I am out of there. Unfortunately, for me, I'm too weak, tired, scared and lame to get much further than the front of the inside of the van. Erstwhile, Parm is on in the back, rufflin' around, swearin' to the only Pagan god he believes in that he's gonna have my head in a jar for what I done to him, RE, blinding him with a scalpel.<br />\r\nJAKE: Was it worth it?<br />\r\nAMIR: Let me work it, ha ha.<br />\r\n(JAKE shakes his head, AMIR whispers 'wow')<br />\r\nJAKE: All this destruction.<br />\r\nAMIR: It was nerf ifinifin when yet and you're not even cracking up-<br />\r\nJAKE: This carnage...<br />\r\nAMIR: Yup, a smile.<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, was it worth changing your stupid nose over?<br />\r\nAMIR: If you're talking about blinding Parm then you should know that he was nearly blind to begin with, okay?

I don't think I want to know.<br />\r\nAMIR: Here's what I do: I, uh, put a nice leather couch up on Craigslist saying it's available for free to a good home.

You just told me something really mean-spirited and weird that you do, so I asked you why.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh! [laughs] No, I just, uh, I like to let people down.

[whispering, to Jake] Watch this! [on the phone] Unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! Yes, it is because of how you answered the question. [laughs] No, no, I'm not being cute with you, uh... you really-- you disappointed your daughter on this one. Alright. Okay. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye then. [hangs up, resumes washing the bowl]<br />\r\nJAKE: She asked if you were being cute with her?<br />\r\nAMIR: I told her I was being \"cheeky\".<br />\r\nJAKE: No you didn't. I'm sitting right here.

Why'd you bring that bucket--<br />\r\nAMIR: Mickey! Mickey, Mickey, Mickey... no no, you have to get out of my apartment, Mickey. Okay? I'm sorry, but you are officially trespassing, Mickey, and I have a good mind to call the police about it.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, you left him a key. That's not exactly trespassing.<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh. Oh! Oh God, Mickey-- No no no, I can hear-- Oh, I can hear you breaking stuff, Mickey! Please...

Don't do anything you can't take back, Mickey. Oh, Mickey, I'm begging you.<br />\r\nJAKE: You say \"Mickey\" so much when you talk to him, it's crazy.<br />\r\nAMIR: [still pleading] Mickey!

Going to die! On me!<br />\r\n[Amir performs mouth-to-mouth. Jake, who was never unconscious in the first place, is trying to fight Amir off.]<br />\r\nAMIR: He's alive!

For the record, I did answer the question, unequivocally.<br />\r\nAMIR: I know he gets paid, ass.

That wasn't too hard...<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't say it.<br />\r\nAMIR: [drawn out] ...ass!<br />\r\nJAKE: The mystery is not solved. Alright?

No no no, I should email Business Insider, because hey-- that's breaking news!

Um, as you know, my dad... is not feeling well; he's sick, he's very sick--<br />\r\nAMIR: I ate with Jake! I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, and I don't care who knows it!<br />\r\nJAKE: I do. I care who knows it. And you know what? We didn't even eat breakfast together. I was in line at Starbucks and you stood behind me eating loose egg salad out of a plastic bag!<br />\r\nAMIR: [pauses, then bursts out laughing] I love that! Breakfast club is nothing if not ribbing on each other! [still cheery] Cool it with the name-calling though, 'cause I'm secretly depressed about that kind of shit.<br />\r\nJAKE: First of all, I didn't even call you a name just now. Second, you're not secretly depressed about anything. You're outwardly depressed about it. The barista called you \"hun\" and you started crying!<br />\r\nAMIR: [making a kazoo-like humming sound with his nose as he talks] \"Hum\"? Like my nose emits a humming noise? Excuse me, but I have a deviated septum about that kind of shit! Where does she get off calling me that, that-- that queen, that diva, that roach?<br />\r\nJAKE: Why do you think she said \"hum\"? By the way, you name-call a lot, for someone who doesn't like it.<br />\r\nAMIR: [still humming] I hate it when it's used on me.

You're dumb, and you're mean, and... and your nose does emit a humming noise!<br />\r\nAMIR: [humming] And time! Congratulations, you've ruined the warming glow of breakfast by ten AM! Hey, it's a new record, bud!<br />\r\nJAKE: Look how fast you turned on me. How quickly you went from happy to sad. [Amir is suddenly happy] From calm to angry. [Amir is suddenly angry again] Is that normal?<br />\r\nAMIR: [humming] Maybe.<br />\r\nJAKE: I don't think it is. I think you should just try to be nice, and quiet, for five minutes in a row.

[gives a thumbs-up] Nice, bud.<br />\r\nAMIR: [still out of breath] Yeah, last night for dinner, I was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know.

Really hard.<br />\r\nAMIR: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.<br />\r\nJAKE: This is chalk!<br />\r\nAMIR: That is uncalled for!

I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!<br />\r\nAMIR: Appreciated!<br />\r\nJAKE: Never a compliment.<br />\r\nAMIR: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam! [Handing Jake a plastic container with a live rabbit sitting in it] Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread. [laughing] Now you have me saying \"chalk\", ya dingbat!<br />\r\nJAKE: How?<br />\r\nAMIR: No-- I don't know how! You said \"chalk\", and then suddenly I'm saying \"chalk\" instead of \"bread\". It's a whole thing.<br />\r\nJAKE: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?<br />\r\nAMIR: It is jam!

I really think there's a miracle happening right now.<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm just rifling through my pockets, trying to figure out, you know, little hints about my past, and there's, like, this... barbecue sauce container, a-- a clump of blond hair, and this really poorly-worded note.<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what, man? I think you put on some... some weird loser's pants. Some small coward. Okay? But... but he's gone now. I think... I think luck, or fate, or God finally intervened, and I really think he might not ever come back.<br />\r\nAMIR: [reading the note] \"Clone Jake with his hair if he's ever being a bitchly.\" [bringing the lock of hair up to Jake's head] Are you Jake?<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm Josh.

[tilts iPhone, smirkingly]<br />\r\nAMIR: The only app that's worth a damn on here is 'Grindr', I'm actually 10 for 10 on that shit! Huh, it works perfectly, if you don't mind who fucks you and where.<br />\r\nJAKE: Has it ever been a girl?<br />\r\nAMIR: Not as of yet, nay!<br />\r\nAMIR: [scrolling through iPhone] I'm on 'match.com', but it says I'm 0% compatible with everybody!<br />\r\nJAKE: I definitely believe that!

I was really afraid of how that punch would change us. How it would effect us going forward as friends.<br />\r\nAMIR: Actually met a girl on 'MySpace', invited her back to my Place, to sit on my face. Hehe<br />\r\nJAKE: Did that work?<br />\r\nAMIR: Absolutely not! Much to my disgrace! Huhu She, erm... She sued me! Which...

She left a not so stellar review on this diner that I frequent, so I messaged her and begged her to open an 'AshleyMadison' account. I gave her access to my PayPal address and eh, she is not using it responsibly! Bitch is bleeding me dry and her husband is threatening me on the daily with bodily harm! I guess that's why I'm single! [he says, satirically] Hehe<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes! It is.<br />\r\nAMIR: Chill!

No, I don't laugh at anything you say when you say it.

And he won't return my call, I got a fuckin' problem...<br />\r\nJAKE: Hey-- whoa--<br />\r\n[Amir backs up and falls off the balcony.

You showed up on the casino floor last night, drunker than I've ever seen anyone.<br />\r\nAMIR: I was blackout... with my cack out!<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes, it was. You were wearing a leather jacket, a French beret, and nothing else.<br />\r\n[Amir lifts his crotch out of the water. He's completely naked.]<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh yeah!<br />\r\nJAKE: [disgusted] Oh! Warts!<br />\r\nAMIR: No!<br />\r\nJAKE: You jumped on the roulette table, instantly pulled your hamstring, but you decided to power through.<br />\r\n[Amir smirks at Lydia.]<br />\r\nJAKE: You said \"I'm the maitre d'! Who wants fish and chips?\" You pointed up at the rafters, like a weakling Babe Ruth, you pulled out a flounder or a... or a sea bass or something...<br />\r\n[Amir is now wearing Lydia's shades over his glasses.]<br />\r\nJAKE: You tossed a thousand dollars' worth of chips in the air, and you hit it across the casino floor like... l-- like you were, like you were playing Tee Ball or something!<br />\r\n[Amir and Lydia laugh. Lydia is wearing Amir's glasses, and her shades are missing.]<br />\r\nJAKE: Then, you tried to charge what you thought was the mound, and you ended up hitting an elderly Walmart greeter on vacation with her dying husband. Closed-fisted.<br />\r\nAMIR: [wearing both glasses and shades again] Flounder!<br />\r\nJAKE: I said flounder!<br />\r\nAMIR: [wearing just his normal glasses] You said sea bass! ...Sea bass!<br />\r\nJAKE: Security was called, but you were covered in fish grease, naturally, so you were able to slip through their arms. The pit boss announced a rousing game of \"catch the slimy Jew\", and a group of Asian businessmen bet against you, and won, when you ran full-speed, head-first into a Sex and the City slot machine.<br />\r\nAMIR: That was a classic Samantha move. I'll admit it. I'll be the first to admit it!<br />\r\nJAKE: There was a deafening crack, [Amir pulls a face] and everybody started to surround what they were sure-- what they hoped, actually-- was a dead body...<br />\r\n[Amir is wearing the glasses and shades again.]<br />\r\nJAKE: ...until you awoke mid-sentence, suing the casino, which I guess is when they upgraded you to this ridiculous suite.<br />\r\nAMIR: [with normal glasses] Thus concludes your tale of woe and worry, but alas, everything worked in the end! [picks up a handful of bubbles] Bubble bath! Bubble bubble bubble bath. [blows them at Jake]<br />\r\nJAKE: No it didn't! Security took you up here and started showing you suite after suite, but it was clear that you had taken this... miraculous turn of events for... more than granted! You kept on claiming \"none of these rooms are Mac Daddy enough!\" Finally, in this one, you demanded to know whether the balcony was stable or not. When the concierge went out there, you locked the door behind her...<br />\r\n[Amir smirks at Lydia, who is wearing his glasses.]<br />\r\nJAKE: ...and then, in a final brazen act of cowardice, you tried to set the room on fire. Unsuccessfully.<br />\r\nAMIR: [with his normal glasses] Except I burned my finger, okay? If I may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?<br />\r\nJAKE: That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.<br />\r\nAMIR: You don't have to be a roach about it!<br />\r\nJAKE: Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled \"I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?\"<br />\r\n[Amir blows more bubbles toward Jake.]<br />\r\nJAKE: That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--<br />\r\n[Lydia jumps out of the tub and begins strangling Jake.]<br />\r\nLYDIA: What did you say? [to Amir] You promised! [continues screaming at Jake]<br />\r\nJAKE: What? [to Amir] You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!<br />\r\nAMIR: Kat! I said you could say anything you wanted to in front of Kat! That's Lydia! She's a feisty one.

What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work.

Amir and Murph come up behind him, wearing oven mitts and carrying a giant pot of pea soup.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Who wants soup?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR/MURPH: April Fools!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir and Murph dump all of the soup on top of Jake, who lets out a blood-curdling scream.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Cut to Jake lying on his stomach on a stretcher. His shirt is off, and his back is covered in cloth bandages. Amir walks over to him.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I know you're not mad at me, okay, but I can't help but feel that you're a little bit pissed at the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm mad at you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Whoa! Did not expect or deserve that tongue-lashing!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what I didn't expect or deserve? To be burned alive. Leave me alone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Fine!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir stops talking, but doesn't leave. He looks around idly for a bit, then bends over and puts his face next to Jake.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Want to know the worst part?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I know the worst part. It was the feeling of the flesh falling off my back, after--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's that April Fools is like ruined now almost. [standing back up] Not in a good way, either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: How can you ruin something in a good way?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm just saying that I feel like every April you'll be reminded of this little snafu, and I won't be able to play another epic prank on you without this green cloud hovering over us!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, you know what, dude? I think I will remember this every April. I'll remember this every week, every day, for the rest of my life. I will never forgive, never forget--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Today just got sucks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Today got sucks when you scalded my back with soup.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Murph shows up.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: 'Sup, Jake. ...Making Amir feel bad again?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Leave me alone, Murphy! Alright? My back really kills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [leaning over, whispering to Jake] I think that you owe Amir an apology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [whispering] What? Why?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Murph stands up, and rips one of the bandages off of Jake's back.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [screaming] Owwwww, I'm sorry!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [leaning over] I don't think Amir could hear you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [whimpering] Ohh...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Because you were yelling like a bitch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I guess kinda I could hear him...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [high-pitched stammering] Yeah, he could hear me! Hear that? He said he could hear me!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...though Murph does raise a good point that it was a little bit masked by, b-- by the, by the bitchly screaming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: So let's try that again, Jake. [Jake whimpers again] This time, without the bitchly screaming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Weak! I'm so--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Murph tears another bandage off.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [screaming, crying] Owwwwwww!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Amir, do you accept that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I mostly do, but maybe not completely, because he didn't finish the sentence. He was like, \"I'm sorr-- aaaaah!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Man, this is so fucked! Even for you guys! ...It's too dark! I don't like this!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Amir, should we give Jake one more chance to apologize like a man... [leaning down to Jake] and not scream like a bitch?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't want him to get hurt--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Good, man! You hear that? He doesn't want me to get hurt!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: --though, on the other hand, everybody does deserve a second chance, and maybe another rip will give Jake that opportunity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [to Jake] Everyone deserves a second... [ripping off another bandage] chance!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [screaming] Owwwww, God, no, no! What's wrong with you, you sick fucking... it--...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Murph is massaging Jake's back, the skin of which is surprisingly intact and undamaged.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...I feel... I, I... I feel no pain. What are you doing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [smiling calmly] I'm applying warming jelly to your back. Jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold. [Amir nods] You went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns. [staring off into the distance, still massaging Jake] It's funny, you know? You're always wondering what to expect... maybe you should start expecting what to wonder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Y--... y-- you still ruined my clothes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Oh shit, I'm sorry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND",

[As he speaks, he tries to put his arm around Jake, but Jake keeps fighting him off.] We're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in Williamsburg, Virginia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright, can you stop doing that? We're not in a townhouse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Okay, that's my fault. It's the wrong listing. [flipping through listings] Aaah!

Haaaaaakuna matata! Nothing happens. That's just to scare it, to get ready. Cut to seventeen hours later: I'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off.

Amir materializes from nothing into the chair beside him.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh hey there!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Jesus Christ, dude!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What are you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Been thinking a bit about poster ideas; thought I could run a few by you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Poster ideas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't you think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I think I can make 'em funny!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: We should come up with a ratings system. So instead of you saying, like, \"this is good, this is bad\", you'll be like \"this is amber, this is taupe\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: So taupe is bad?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No no no, taupe is great. Amber is just better than that, and if something is ultimate, it's gray.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's a poster of Jordan, right-- Air Jordan, probably-- and he's soaring through the sky and slammin' it home! [putting his hand on Jake's shoulder]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Stop touching me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Pretty--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Pretty unoriginal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Pretty forcefully. Is what I was gonna say. Don't taint my ideas with your negative shit feedback... Christ!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Uh, it's a poster of dank weed, you know, like sticky bud, and there's, like, a girl in a bikini.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright. Taupe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Pretty good. Agreed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's the lowest I could rate it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Huh?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [taps Jake's shoulder] Alright, it's a poster of a clock, right--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't touch me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: --but instead of the hour marks, it's little beers... except at six o'clock, it's a little ears. 'Cause listen up! It's beer-thirty! And I'm thirsty!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's the only time that it wouldn't be beer-thirty. It would be ear-thirty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Amber.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...How dare you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: See if you can wrap your twat around this one: it's a psychedelic black-light poster for a little band I like to call... the Grateful Dead! [pulls a constipated-looking face]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's a really horrible face-- and none of these ideas have been original, okay? It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's actually a pretty dece idea. Maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: God, you're a bad businessman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm not a businessman. I'm a businesswoman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's a picture of a ninety-eight-year-old dude on a toilet, right? Caption: \"I'm gettin' too old for this shit!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That one's kind of funny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Well that one already exists too! So all this shit about me not selling \"originals\"? [doing air quotes] \"You're dumb\"!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Why am I here?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm actually on the fence about even pitching this one, 'cause it's so, like, hyper-offensive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright, well, so don't say anything--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: But it's a [long-sustained bleep, accompanied by a black censor bar over Amir's mouth]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[As Amir describes his poster, he makes violent hand gestures. Jake tries shushing him, then looks around, then tries to interject. None of this is audible over the censor bleep. Eventually Jake slaps Amir to shut him up.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Taupe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: So it's a poster so shiny and reflective that it shows you a mirror image of yourself when you stare at it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: A mirror.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes, Jake?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I didn't say your name. You're pitching me a mirror.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Yes, Jake?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Taupe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Dope.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I can has cheezburger?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Is that a pitch?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No, I'm just hungry, and I was wondering if I can has a... has a cheezburger, actually. I... I hasn't has one in a while, and I was... simply... curious as to whether or not I can has one. A cheezburger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: This one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's entirely a drink. You just pitched me orange soda.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I-- it's just that I'm starving, and I feel like I can has... a whole lot of food, but more than anything else, I... I cazn't has a cheezburger. In fact, I... I cheezn't has a cazburger in quite a while, factually.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I don't care what you eat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I caz hoping I caz has one. With cheez.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's called the Guide to British Smiles, and it's just famous Englishmen and pictures of their fucked-up teeth. It's like half social commentary, half me just being a little bit of a dickling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No, you're just always being a dickling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [mouthing] Wow. [writing]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Still wrote \"amber\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir has a cheeseburger.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oooh, I shouldn't has this! I cazn't has this cheezburger! It'll give me bad cholesterol! I can has bad cholesterol?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I think you're has-ing a stroke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: This one's half poster, half beverage. Okay? It's called an Arnold Palmer!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's all beverage. It's half iced tea, half lemonade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Just tell me if you like it or not!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's a good idea, but it's not yours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Winning! [gives Jake a thumbs-up]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's a 1988 Lamborghini Countach, parked on a hill during a sunset, cherry red! And guess who gets to drive it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Heck no! ...Me in ten years!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Milk?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: God-- can I see your notebook?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You'll never understand my scatterbrain!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [flipping through the pages] Yeah, just page after page of drink ideas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I can has my notebook back now?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You think you invented milk?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Dad?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Alright, just trying to organize my thoughts here. Would you say your top three choices so far have been psychedelic poster, milk, and mirror?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay. That'll suit me well for my first round of funding; the angel round, as it were. By the way, how much could I put you down for? It's a big pie, so feel free to ask for a small little slice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Zero.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That fucking hurts to hear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND",

Call it to my face and see what happens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"I'm have a pussy\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [simultaneously] ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, you've said that before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [mocking Jake] I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Jesus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Jerk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir leans way back into the backseat to look for his sunglasses.

I g--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You idiot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Eyes on the road, buddy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake shushes Amir.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [singing] Beware, beware, beware...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Find the glasses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [singing] ...of a woman with a broken fart!

Okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. [pronouncing \"page\" in French]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Fine. [pause] It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive. [chuckles] Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. \"Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!\" That's what they said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Queen Dweeb\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Queen Dweeb\". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...The pit?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Why did you ask me about peach pits?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [doing an arm signal] I use arm signals. [sticking his arm in front of Jake] Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Eyes on the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: --but... way less effective, too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: So you said \"less\" twice, then.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. \"I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Excuse me?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I was four.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: God, your parents suck, dude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Keep your eyes on the road!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Then take them off!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [leaning back into the backseat again] Let me put them back in the case!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Hey! Dude!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What, dude! Drive, shitbird!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Hey! Come on!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND",

I wouldn't do that, just 'cause you're what my Tinder coach would call an app-killer. You're someone who doesn't just get left-swiped; you actually inspire people to delete the app. [laughing] You're ugly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mean!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Sometimes the truth hurts. You've got to embrace it. I was an app-killer myself before I met Chet, but it only cost me fifty bucks per match to become Mr. Right-Swiped!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Loser!

Just like a... gastric bypass, maybe a tummy-tuck, and a... a face lift.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Nothing too drastic\"? You're talking about... surgery!

[to Jake] Hey, do we have work on Wednesday the 25th?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm not your secretary-- and... come on, of course. We have work every Wednesday--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Can do! Pencil this DJ...! Up? [hangs up]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Not smart. Just gonna confuse him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You'll never in a million years guess what I've been doing lately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Starting a DJ business.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Better. Starting a DJ business.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's what I guessed. Why have a conversation with you if you're just gonna--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [shaking with excitement] Good question! Business is booming!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Business is booming. I'm happy; you're happy for me! [laughs] I'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean I'm not makin' bank! [rubs his fingers together]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes it does! If you're using \"pro bono\" correctly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I can't help it if my Yelp reviews suck!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck! So you improve yourself!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [mouthing] Wow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm looking at them right now. \"DJ Shmumu pressed 'play' on a Spotify playlist and fainted.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"DJ Shmumu fainted upon arrival!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"He woke up and tried to load a Spotify playlist, but promptly fainted again!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Stop saying \"yeah\"!

Get a better diet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [eating bits of sandwich out of his pocket] I'm gluten-free!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...On second thought, man, just let yourself die.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Ouch much? [chuckles] That hurt more than my last Yelp review!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Right, which it looks like you wrote thirty seconds ago, so I guess you wrote it as you were fainting. \"DJ Shmumu's pretty good, but he deserves to die. Hold on, I think I'm fainting.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir's phone rings. Amir picks up.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mickey, my friend!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Hang up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes, my friend. I too am excited and eager to be DJing your daughter's wedding tonight!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Why does he trust you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes, I already spoke to her regarding the playlist; it is set in stone. I assure you she is a lovely bride, and she's gonna get the reception she deserves. I'm actually... setting up the turntables as we speak, Mickey!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [shaking his head] Why do you do this?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Not to give too much away, Mickey, but I figure we start with the Hora, move on to some playful, yet tasteful, Golden Oldies, before transitioning beautifully and seamlessly to the father-daughter dance! I believe the one you requested... [typing on his keyboard, winking to Jake] let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! It's called \"I'm not actually DJing your daughter's wedding tonight, Mickey!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Here we go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: She's gonna be an ugly bride, Mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, Mickey!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That has nothing to do with being a DJ.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You know why, Mickey? Because my Yelp reviews suck, Mickey!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: How is that his fault?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: News flash, Mickey: I press play on Spotify... and I faint, Mickey! Yeah! I really faint, Mickey! In fact, Mickey... I'm fainting right now, Mickey... Mickey, help me out, Mickey. [drops the phone]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [yelling to be heard over the phone] He fainted, Mickey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mickey!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Mickey, he's gone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mickey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Hey Mickey, let's hope he dies, huh?

See you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Mike leaves.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Hey, I wish I knew y'all were eating today. I would have packed a lunch, or bought one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You didn't know we were eating today? By the way, looks like you did pack a lunch. Just a... giant bag of carrots, but still.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What's the point of conversation as it stands right now? I can wax poetic about a myriad of hot topics. [takes a bite of a carrot]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPAUL: New York versus LA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay... and what's the consensus? Just so I can play devil's advocate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPAT: No consensus, really. We;re just saying they're different.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: And in terms of theses differences, are we excited or thrown by them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You don't need all of the information. Okay? Just see if you can enter a conversation seamlessly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [taking another bite] Easy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Paul shakes his head.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPAT: ...Right. So... you know, New York just has a way of getting under your skin--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [yelling over Pat] Been thinking about setting up a home theater system shit in my den!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Jesus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What do you guys think is the difference between Sonos and other leading brands like Bose? Or do y'all only like to talk about unimportant shit?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, I think your sound system is unimportant shit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [gesturing with the carrots sticking straight out from his palms] Really! Because last time I checked, audio was the second-most important part of the audio-video experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Worst hands ever; stop doing that-- so it's the least important part, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I just wish we'd talk about my hobbies too, but I feel like I can't even get a word in edgewise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're dominating the conversation! What hobbies do you even have?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely. [chuckles] Box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby. A hobby's an enriching way to spend your spare time, and that's just... that's tearing at the fabric of a loving relationship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: At least we're talking about something!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: We were talking about something.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPAUL: [getting up] I'm gonna...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, of course.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Paul leaves.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Can't handle the heat, huh? F-f-f-f-fatass? [tries to clear his throat] ...I think I might be dying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah. Chew better. Just chew it all the way 'til it's mush, and then swallow. You don't swallow early.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You don't have to tell me twice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't bring an entire bag of carrots to lunch. You bring one or two. I mean, you sat down 'cause you wanted to have a conversation, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I still do.

Now that sounds like a place that's... fun to go!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Isn't Devon Sawa dead?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You're thinking of Brad Renfro.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number six: Check out Brad Renfro's dicks!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake grimaces in disbelief.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"It's been too long since you've gone to see him. Won't you visit his mausoleum?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's impolite. Wouldn't you say that's in poor taste? Can't he rest in peace?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number five: an Owen named Clive! He's got a palace in the English hills, and you can visit and stay for the thrills! Clive Owen would love to have ya.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No he wouldn't! So far, three of your ideas have been about visiting celebrities who definitely don't want you there. One of whom is dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number four: Lock your door! This staycation is for you and a PlayStation 2. Lock yourself in your room all summer and close the blinds. That's the best way I know how to unwinds! And if it's a weekday... go to work!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, that's almost as sad as the Brad Renfro one. How are these vacation ideas? Barely any of them have involved a destination! Most of them have involved not traveling!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Number three: How 'bout some tea? It's a good liquid that's nice for your soul. Have it in a cup, a mug, or a... bowl...\" What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You crossed lists? With another scroll?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Shit. Yeah, I think I musta got...

Okay, here we go. \"Number one: Palm Springs. A desert getaway with your best friend.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Not going with you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Well I know it might be a long snot...\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir puts a finger over one of his nostrils, sharply exhales, and shoots an enormous amount of snot across the desk and onto Jake's shirt.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh!

I can't believe how much came out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"The tickets are booked. The price is right; I looked. So what sayeth thee, my FFB? Will you go away with me?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what, dude? Fuck it. Snot rocket for you. Here we go--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake tries to blow snot like Amir did, but nothing comes out. Jake winces.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Aah! Idiot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake tries again, and fails.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Aah! Ass!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Do it harder, like one--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir demonstrates. Jake tries and fails again.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh no!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake has blood pouring out of his nose.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, no!

They don't affect anyone or anything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPAT: No-- what are your hobbies?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing.

Your mind is so impressionable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: My mind is not impressionable!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes it is!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I guess it is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: God, that's fast. Even for you, that was fast. You're, like, hypnotized. Like, you'll believe anything anyone says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [calmly] I will believe anything anyone says...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake pauses.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [equally calmly] You're getting sleepy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm getting... [closing his eyes] sleepy...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're getting very sleepy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Very sleepy, Master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Didn't say I was your master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Didn't have to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Anything I say is your command. Your mind is open to my suggestion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I am your mental slave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: And thus, you are my master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Fine. Just don't repeat it, okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Fine, Master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...When I snap my fingers, you will wake up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes, Master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: And when you wake up, you will...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Cluck like a chicken. Something silly. Boy, will my face be red.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You'll throw yourself out the window.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Jesus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's right. When I snap my fingers, you will awaken and run out the window.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: My fear is that the window will be closed and I'll break my neck on the glass. Then you'll be left to deal with me as a quadriplegic, Master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Fine. Open the window...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mm-hmm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...then jump.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No chicken. Just jumping. Leaping, out of a four-story window, to your death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Got it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Before you go...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mm-hmm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...remember to shoot me a text. Something like... \"Hey, there was nothing you could have done to stop me\", et cetera.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mm. A suicide note of sorts. Yup.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: A suicide text of sorts. Indeed. So when I snap my fingers--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Absolving you of guilt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Exactly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Got it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Got it. Okay, so I'm gonna snap my fingers. Wake up, suicide text...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Out the window. No chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No clucking-- you can do whatever you want on the way down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Just be sure to do the... you know, the important bullet points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Absolutely. Thank you, Master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake snaps.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [waking up] Aaah. Jesus. [laughing in confusion] What happened?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I don't know, man. Just... whatever. Just chilling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [confused, texting Jake] ...I'm texting you....<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, yeah. Go for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Hmm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [reading, frustrated] Semicolon, dollar sign, \"Jake tried to kill me\", sunglasses emoji, \"I'm not a chicken\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [holding up the newspaper] That's right! My horoscope told me to be on the lookout for hypno-killers, and it was right! Sagittarius, motherfucker!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're a Capricorn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [laughing] You still tried to kill me! Little fucker!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND ",

[Puts stick of gum half in his mouth so that it's sticking out.] What's wrong with you? You're acting all goofy--[Laughs] I mean are you high at work? I'm not gonna tell anyone, I'm just down to toke! Or at least have a bite of whatever edible you're high!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I just don't want--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: My gum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE:--to talk to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I know.

It's on the house!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Did you think I was declining because I thought you were gonna make me pay for it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: The pack was like two bucks! If you wanna toss me a dollar...sure that'd be fine [Chuckles]. That'd be fair--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Fair? No it wouldn't. That would mean I get half the pack of gum, and I said no to a piece. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You said you were OK!? You said you were good--[getting angry] you didn't say jack shit about no. Holy shit; you are high!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Relax! Alright? I'll have a piece of gum. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [Nodding his head] Slice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Piece!

You gotta pay me back somehow, that's how society works! [Pretends to type on computer] I'm not working here for free! [Chuckles]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're not working here at all! [Amir is bobbing up and down on his chair and chewing the gum with his mouth open while Jake is talking.] I don't think I've ever seen you do or complete a single task--chew the gum with your mouth closed. Alright? [Amir's movements become more frantic.] You look so unnatural doing it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [Still chewing with his mouth open.] It's cool. It's friendly. It's chill--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't bob your head--it's not friendly. What's friendly about it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's like [Amir winks awkwardly.

[Amir grimaces.] Really!? [Jake facepalms.] That language?! [Waves pack of gum in the air.] From someone who has something that you want. It's tit for tat, Jakey!

You gotta go mit ma--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Focus! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir doesn't respond or move as he chews his gum loudly, staring at Jake.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I don't wanna sit next to you anymore. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [Stops chewing.] What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I wanna move desks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir swallows the gum.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Jake--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Gum's gone, man...alright? This is...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [Shrugging] Doesn't matter that the gum's gone.

I-i-it's infinitesimal! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's small, maybe, in the grand scheme of things but the grand scheme of things is what I'm worried about, OK? It's a lot of little things, like this, adding up. Also...you know, you stabbed me once--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Once.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: More often than I've stabbed anyone!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Really?...Shit.

We don't have to talk at the office. That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: My legs were tired, fatass! And by the way, this is healthy! Healthier than the standing desk, 'cause I can do crunches while I work! [closes his eyes and begins doing crunches badly]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, well they hurt my back pain!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Redundant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah! I have sciatica, motherfucker!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I think sciatica is pain in your leg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes! Which is why I can't stand. So I sit, which hurts my back. That's why I got the desk! It just hurts, so I'm sitting, AKA!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Jesus!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That was real.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I know, and I mean it every time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [laughing uncomfortably] It's so... sad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Trust me, I know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's sad to me that you want me dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah.

She couldn't flap her wings fast enough.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Flap her wings?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Did I mention Sale was a goose?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I guess you can say she's trans-gandered!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [with his hand on his mouth] Sure, small price to pay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Were!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Still! A goose!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No, I mean me and Leron aren't cousins anymore! He frickin' divorced me!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR; Dentures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Which you stole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: How was your weekend? ...Always talkin' about my shit. How was your Friday? What'd you do Saturday morning?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Where are your real teeth?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I traded them to Leron for a BeDazzler so that I can jewel-encrust Sale's dentures so that I can flaunt my father's wealth! What don't you get?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Why do you hate yourself?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Excuse?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE You're on this twisted quest to change your body, mind, and spirit. You're constantly adopting new hobbies. [Amir begins dancing in his seat.] You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing! [Amir stops.] None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir makes a mock-hurt expression.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, I know that did hurt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir dabs his forehead, and salutes Jake sarcastically. Jake salutes him back. Amir pauses, and then begins crying.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: There it is. [claps] Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Want to know the gayest part?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't use that word like that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I truly believe that the world revolves around me. [pauses, nods thoughtfully] Not even metaphorically, either. Like, uh, say this marble is me, and this tennis ball is our solar system? [picks up a marble and a tennis ball, and rolls the tennis ball around the marble]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Quick to get those.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, this is how I feel. Like I am at the center of it. Like I'm the Sun. [chuckles] I mean, how dumb is that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah? Well at least I got a grill I can count on! [holds up a sausage] Hope you like sausage!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Raw meat.

That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you Vance!

Yeah, I know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: A gala. Yeah, exactly right, a gala.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Tell you what, buddy.

[speaking to Jake] Shittiest Weekend of the Ever Award goes to, dumroll please... Amir Hurwitz! \"You like me! You really like me!\" Friday night, I crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the God's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! Their aunt Flo didn't just come into town to visit. She moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. I wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. They tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! Keep in mind, this was 7:45 PM, so it's still bright out and I'm missing Jeopardy! I will take \"Things You Don't Want Your Parents to See after Leaving a Restaurant for Their Forty-Second Anniversary\" for, let's say, two hundred, Alex.

Bom, bom. What is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! And what did you wager, Alex? Zero dollars? That's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his Motorola Krzr and added me to his SnapStory. What? Just as I start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if I don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows, [pointing to his body] and start assaulting my face, [pointing to his neck] my body, [pointing to his face] and my neck. All of them had hair of gold, [singing the \"Brady Bunch\" theme] like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! One landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. Finally, out of fear, loathing, or Las Vegas, I j-- [chuckles] I just start spray-shitting everywhere. Yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. I am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. With the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face, [Ace Ventura impression] I finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. One more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. It's-- it's pretty broad, actually. [taking off his glasses] It goes a little something like this: A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, \"Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen.\" The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, \"That bus driver just insulted me.\" I said, \"Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake chuckles.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh-- no.

[making a circle with his thumb and finger, looking through] All the better to spee you with, my dear!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Spee\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Spee and sy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Spee and sy\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Spee and spy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Spee and spy\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: See and sy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Still, you're using the word \"spee\", so what are you mixing it with?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Spee and sy-- see and spy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"See and spy\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: As in, be inspired... fuckward!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Let me shatter your perfect world for a second. Every time you had phone sex on that phone of yours, it was actually an orgy. A group orgy. Yeah, there's not just corporate spies on the line, man! There's legit frickin' government agendas reading your sex and getting off to every adjective! \"What are you wearing?\" I'll tell you what it is! It's the new Apple iCloak! [slowly getting more high-pitched] But it's not invisibility, it's actually visibility! AKA, the visible ability... for Apple Geniuses... to get off! Jerk off! Nut to you! [laughing]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Shut up! What's funny? Why do you believe this, and why would you be amused?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir holds up his iPhone, which has a card taped to it.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Smile! [takes a picture] You're on Dipshit Camera! I just got a picture of the biggest dumbass I know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Was it a selfie?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Fuck off. What's that supposed to mean, \"was it a selfie\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's a joke. Come on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [doing an accent] When we designed the new iPhone, we had one facet that had to be absolutely necessary, and that was the fact that we wanted to jerk off!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Your dick's actually out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: So we put a camera here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, everywhere! [laughing]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: There are just two cameras. Alright? Stop adding your own cameras. By the way, you have an iPhone. You're holding it right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mine's jailbroken, you fucking idiot! It's running Linux, Java!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Is your social security card taped to the back of it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! You know why? So that I don't lose it, dipshit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're a dipshit. I never even said I wanted the new iPhone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Good. 'Cause every front-facing camera, of which there are probably a baker's dozen--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: There aren't.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: --is a glory hole for Jobs, Woz, and Spielberg to fuck you with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You think Steve Spielberg wants to fuck you through the front-facing camera of your iPhone?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I didn't say it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You're paranoid-- you did say it. You're delusional.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm serious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I know you're serious. You're also horny or something, 'cause you keep on talking about masturbating.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You don't get it! You got your iMac, your iCloud, your iPad, your iPod... it's all I I I! Ay-ay-ay! It should be you! [making a U-shape with his hand] It should be you, you, you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You are ugly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Ouch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir begins crying, but immediately stops and squeals when he sees a mailman approaching with a package for him.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [laughing] It's here, it's here!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir opens the box.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Is that an iPhone?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [yelling] Yeah, but I'm gonna hack it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND",

Amir is playing a guitar.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: So when I take my hand and go with you, be sure to leave me high, to do... goodbye, my love, goodbye, my-- prrd. To each her own, to each her... I love you...! [stops singing] ...Stupid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: So stupid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's crazy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That you did that at work?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [balancing the guitar on the desk] Guitar's like... part of my body at this point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir lets go of the guitar, and it falls hard to the floor. Jake cringes.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Did that hurt?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's actually a polished final. On vinyl, actually, but if you have a note or a feedback, I'd love to hear it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: If I had a single feedback? Not to write music. Don't write music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Joke's on you, 'cause music's not about a single note. It's about a harmony. [laughs] Not surprised you didn't know that, though, 'cause you don't know shit about folk, or folk about shit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You have a job here. I don't know why, but you do, so why don't you focus on being good at that. For instance, you didn't even bring a computer charger today. I guess you just figured two hours of work and then you'd be done. And if you don't want to get good at your job, which is... I guess bad, but, fine-- focus on things that would make you a better human being, like hygiene. Brush your teeth. Wipe your ass.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's funny, I don't remember that part of the song! How about giving me notes about melody, about tune, about how it sounded?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Okay. So you're not listening to me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I am. I'll do that. I'll do the stuff about the brushing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do what?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Brush my hair!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What's something that you don't brush? Not your hair. What's something else that you don't brush?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't brush my hair, ya fuckin' idiot! [laughs]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Teeth!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I know!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You don't know!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I know!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake doesn't respond.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [slurring his phrase into a single syllable] Iknow! ...I just want to do shit that makes me smile of you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I knew this would happen. I knew as soon as I went off and did something cute and subjective, you would turn it into this, this, this, this, this, this nuclear bomb of me!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what? Talk normal. Okay? \"Nuclear bomb of me\"? \"Smile of you\"? You're digressing! You used to be able to speak English.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir is raising his arms defensively.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Put your arms down! What are you doing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Your attitude almost makes me not want to write a song and perform it for you at work... yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Good. That... that is the first time I've ever seen you come close to making a right decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Excuse...?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That inkling that you have--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You're a dickling!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I said \"inkling\", but you are the dickling. Okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You're a dickling!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: The inkling that you have, to not do something because you know I'll think it's dumb? That's the first step into, I guess, adolescence. You finally have the social intelligence of an eleven-year-old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Well if you like that song, then you truly are the apple of my pie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir pulls out an apple pie, and pies himself in the face with it. It slides off gradually, and Amir looks disappointed in himself.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [to himself] Why'd you do that, ya idiot? ...You turn every positive into a weird thing of you. Just take the compliment, Hurwitz! You are an anal assassin of the highest calendar. He finally was on your side. He liked the song.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I never said I liked the song.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You said I had the social intelligence of an eleven-year-old!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...What word in that sentence says \"song\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: AKA!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I have to work from home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Of course!

A woman's underwear. I wonder how that got in there-- oh, maybe it was from a one-night stand I had with a 10!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [grabbing the underwear] You know what? This is embarrassing, 'cause I saw you open a new package of women's underwear, smell them, crumple them up, and put them in the bottom of the bag. You fake-dropped them on the floor in front of me twice, hoping I would notice, then you finally just dangled them in front of my face and said \"how embarrassing\". You are a loser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: In retrospect, she might have been a 9.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do you want to wash them or not?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I do not.

It's just cotton clothing. You reek of piss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Eureka! [laughs] Sorry.

Ever been to a foam party?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know, you ruined all your clothes, you broke your washer, it's gonna cost you a lot of money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: To get into the club?

Like two weeks ago, I walk up to a family of four in a waiting room who's [air quotes] \"awaiting news\", and I'm just covered in fake blood, and I go, \"I'm... so sorry.\" They start bawling, I can't even keep a straight face!

Now come down here and give me cash or I'll boogie you.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You also mentioned the other side of his sign said \"Why lie? I need pot\", so I think you might have just gotten swindled by a homeless man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Perhaps, maybe. Mayhaps, probably.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Probably.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen.

Get ready, I'm gonna boogie you.\" [Amir flinches.] So you ran away to the nearest ATM, and took out even more money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, the boogeyman's appetite for cash was insatiable, to be sure. But, I stood up for myself.

He and his date are sitting in uncomfortable silence. She brushes her hair away from her eyes, and in response, Amir makes a face as if he's straining to hear something she said.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [almost inaudibly] Hm?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir's date just shakes her head. They sit in silence for a while longer, and then she yawns.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: And I win! You spoke first, and thus I have the upper hand now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR'S DATE: I didn't say anything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Power play. [chuckles] What's so funny, maggot?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR'S DATE: Nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Look, this isn't my first rodeo, okay? I'm on Tinder, Grindr, GROWLr, OKCupid, SoGayStupid, Twinge, Hinge, JDate, JSwipe, YouPorn, JYouPorn... I've seen it all, honey. What's your poison?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR'S DATE: \"Twinge\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I have not heard of that one. Is that a digestif?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR'S DATE: You said Twinge. I don't know what that is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [to the server] Let's get my date a wine, and I think I will have... twinge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The server pours Amir's date a glass of wine. As he stops pouring, Amir tips his hand back the way it was, filling the glass to the very top. Unable to pick it up without spilling it, Amir's date leans in to sip from it.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: So here's what I'm gonna offer you: [holding up a wad of bills] this is five hundred dollars in cash, and it's yours if you leave right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[She grabs the cash and begins counting.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Just know that if you do take the money and run, that's it. You can't come back. No more second date. Sort of a coy little way to figure out if my dates are in it for the long Paul! [holds up a picture of Paul Dano]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir's date leaves with the money.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...No one's ever not taken the cash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Cut to black.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Fuck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The rest of Amir's night is presented in a melancholy montage. Amir walks home, twitching with frustration. For lack of any emotional outlet, Amir lunges at a homeless man to try and make him flinch. The man lunges back, growling. Amir screams and runs away.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir enters his dark apartment and locks the door. He kicks one shoe off and tosses it into the corner, then flops down on his bed. He kicks off his other shoe, and it nearly hits him in the face. By his bedside table, we see that Amir has several pictures of Jake.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir unbuckles his belt and puts his hand in his pants. He masturbates while staring listlessly at the ceiling of his apartment.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [orgasming] Oooo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir opens a packet of barbecue sauce and puts it on some chicken nuggets for himself.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir stares into the mirror, holding a toothbrush with toothpaste on it, and contemplates brushing his teeth. He shakes his head, and puts the toothbrush back down, throwing the toothpaste tube onto the sink counter with it.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir lies in bed, still numb. A framed picture of him and Jake sits in the background on his bedside table. Amir quietly begins crying.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir comes in to the office the next day, and sits down in the chair in solemn silence. Jake stares at him, waiting for something.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [suddenly as energetic as ever] Got laid last night! [laughs]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND",

[singsong] Thank you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir is at his desk, and has Jake on video chat on his computer.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...So...?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You called me. It's not my job to start a conversation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh, my Thanksgiving? Of course! I'll tell you everything. [chuckles] I was excited to see my loved ones and enjoy a festive meal. Unfortunately, nothing went according to flan! [holds up flan on a plate, laughs at his own joke, and then drops it on his desk] Anyway, listen to this boar shit! I get home Thanksgiving Eve Eve, and I don't know if it's the excitement or the fact that I haven't showered in a couple of... evers, but I develop a zit the size of a gumball on my forehead! I think it's inconvenient, sure, but when I woke up to my dad trying to lance and drain the bitch with a toothbrush he sharpened like a shiv, I'm equal parts appalled and dumb! The vain diva! He said my blemish would ruin everyone's appetite and holiday. So I says to him, I says, straight up, \"Look, I don't have to have dinner with you guys. Frankly, I don't want to have dinner with you guys. But I gotta eat something, or I'm gonna be hangry.\" That's hungry and angry. So he sits silently for a spell, right, and I see something wash over him, this quiet serenity, and I realize this dingbat's gonna lock me in the room! That's the split-second we both charge for the door, and maybe I knock him off course, or maybe he frickin' slipped on the oil dripping from the golf-ball-sized zit, but the roach barrels headlong into the door jamb, and he's out cold. I'm talking frigid, frigid cold. His body is ice, his pulse is... is not. Keep in mind, my old man's forty-two, so at this point, him being dead is no bueno. No bueno at all. So I, I get down on my knees and I pray that the CPR that I saw on an episode of House M.D. on somebody else's TV on an airplane five years ago fucking registered with me! That's right, I'm pumping his chest, leaning in, giving him deep mouth-to-mouth, tongue and all, and having never performed or understood the maneuver, going on just what friggin' Hugh Laurie did on the show, and my daddy's not having any of it. He starts kicking and screaming, and I shout \"Hold still or you're a dead! You're an absolute dead!\" and he-- of course, he takes that the wrong way, I mean look at me! [breaks down into cackling] He reaches down into his pocket, all of a sudden, Papa's [suddenly singing] all about that Mace, 'bout that Mace, no bubble. As in he burst my bubble, when he realized I wasn't the George-Clooney-shaped hero that he hoped I was when he P-sprayed me in the face! The noxious liquid, of absolute course, does nothing to help the zit situation, or zituation for short, and the thing swells up to the size of a tennis ball, throbbing, pulsating, and yes, eventually speaking. Unintelligent squeaks at first, but gaining intelligence by the nanosecond, a full-on sentient staph infection, methinks! My dad gets one look at this horror show, and, and-- and of course he dives out of the window, presumably to his death, but probably not, because my, my room's in the basement. I look in the mirror, and the zit, speaking in tongues at this point, though I understand, demands that I feed it. To a regular human, it's: [makes grotesque noises from his throat] --to me, it's: \"Feed me, feed me, feed me!\" [laughs] So I march downstairs on the pimple's order and begin using the turkey syringe thing, the, uh... the, the, you know, the little ear-bulb thing, the, uh, the... [as if Jake had said something] ...right, the baster. And I'm squeezin' and suckin', feeding and pouring the gravy on the zit, feeding the zit gravy, like it's the opposite of volca-- of a volcano, and it grows, both in size and anger. Finally, the bitch is so big, I'm beginning to think I'm a growth on it, and not the other way around! I mean, at this point, it's borderline comical! So naturally, I throw up my hands and I laugh. Which is right when my dad comes in and sees this-- I mean, I-- how can you describe this as, as anything else but a burlesque show? It really is a burlesque show! And he starts chuckling to himself, and I'll share credit with the evil whitehead, but I got to admit, I'm feeling not bad, because this is the first time, probably ever, that I've seen my dad smile. We go to high five, he misses, probably on purpose, and boom! He hits my zit/boil/Lord and Savior, and boom goes the dynamite. The noise is deafening. And what an explosion! Oh, the humanity! I mean, the entire room is covered in pus and gravy. It looks like... it looks like the inside of an unnatural cave, just stalactites and stalagmites of, of, of, of, of, of this, this, this, this, this, this mucus. This, this pussy, mucusy gravy. So I look-- I look at my old man, this, this forty-two-year-old raisin of a prune at this point, and I go, \"So, uh... who wants pizza?\" [laughing] He starts laughing so hard... he faints, and then my mom is also passing out, because of the, uh... the pus everywhere is steamy hot, so she's sort of suffocating on the moisture, and she faints too, and then just before I pass out, I have this thought, this, this fleeting thought, I'm like, uh... \"How the hell did I turn out so normal?\" [pauses, sighs, then waves his hand at the screen] Y'ello? Can you hear me?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Throughout Amir's entire story, Jake has been ignoring him, occupying himself instead by texting, peeling a sticker off of a thermos, and even leaving to get chips at one point. Until the present moment, Amir has been too immersed in his own story to notice.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yo! Hey, um, sorry. I muted you, in case you told a story that made me sad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh! No wonder you didn't... [holding up the flan] you didn't laugh at the flan joke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I heard the flan joke. That was when I muted you.

[gesturing with his fists, while the gloves' fingers flap everywhere] Ebola is an epidemic, which means you're at risk everywhere! Okay? Last time I checked, you weren't Superman!

I don't know, I can't explain it! I'm on the edge of my seat. I'm not even halfway done with the second episode, and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I can't get enough! I literally started, like, three weeks ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: So you're not obsessed at all! You barely listen to it.

You just have to have an opinion, dumbass!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Your opinion doesn't have to be angry!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'll often post without doing very much research at all, just passing off biased viewpoints as fact!

Thoughts?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Has it been done?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Alright, what if I forgo the canvas, and just straight up paint on a building?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, that's street art. That's pretty fun. Sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's not fun, if it's been done!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's an awful slogan, and a bad way to live your life. It insinuates that nobody but you can have a good idea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Exactly right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yet all of your ideas so far have been unoriginal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Forget it, I said!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No you didn't! You never said what you said you said. I don't think I've ever seen you say what you said you said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You know, what the big issue is is that I was born too late, so all the good shit's already been done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: How dare you? You have every modern convenience. I mean, this is probably the only era that you could survive in--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I would have killed it in Egypt, as a slave. Did you know, actually, here's a-- ...I came up with the pyramids.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What about a dude?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Is your goal to paint something totally original?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Mm-hmm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's never been painted before?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: And your first three ideas were a dude--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [simultaneously] Dude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: --a girl--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [simultaneously] A girl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: --and a landscape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Nature, yeah.

So to recap, you think you think you came up with the pyramids...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...and \"Let It Be\"...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [simultaneously] \"Let It Be\". Correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...before-- independently of those things--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [simultaneously] Of the Beatles. Yeah, exactly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Got it. Okay, anything else? By the way, you did not hum \"Let It Be\" right--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Cold cuts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Head of a frog, body of a deer... he's golfing by himself, under the ocean, the floor is fire. Have you seen that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I guess not. No.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Perfect!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Can you paint it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No, not without an easel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Get out of here. Please. Go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [getting up and walking away] Jesus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Through the window, if you don't mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [walking back the other way] Are you kidding me?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm not kidding!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEND<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[An extended take.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Cold cuts, was me. Sliced turkey, sliced, uh... stuff like that. Have you had a sandwich today?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Sliced turkey-- you couldn't come up with another meat?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake and Amir both crack up.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: But you invented cold cuts?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I don't remember everything I did.",

Alright? Why compost? Why now?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I have my affairs in order. I figure my life's on the right track, so why not pick up a hobby?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah?

I mean, that's an acorn. And when I ask you a simple math question, you reply with a noise. Not a number, and not a word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Gid is a word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's, of course, not a word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Wanna bet?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Sure, yeah. Let's bet. If gid's not a word, you get rid of the compost bin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: And if it is a word, then I keep the compost, and you eat what's inside!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Sounds great.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake does an internet search.

[throwing up a peace sign] What's up, man?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: A lot is up. Amir said you reneged on a bet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: How do you know so fast?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Because we're tight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir nods.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: What was the bet, Jake?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Honestly, it wasn't even a bet. It was just a-- we were just having a funny conversation. Alright? That was it. And if you'll leave me alone, I won't be afraid. My aunt's birthday is today, she's turning fifty-one, we have a nice little--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [yelling] What--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake jumps, and shakes in fear.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: ...was the bet, Jake?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: He bet me gid wasn't a word, and it is a word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Of course gid is a word. It's a disease found in sheep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Okay, fair enough. But he's making compost at the office. Alright? He's keeping filthy, weird, smelly soil here at work, and that's not okay, so... so I have an idea: why don't we team up? Me and you. One time. Jake and Murph. We'll make him afraid of us. [extends his hand for a shake]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: Composting is an energy-efficient way to recycle and garden. It's plenty okay. What's not okay is reneging on bets. Now what were the stakes?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It was twenty dollars. Twenty-dollar iTunes gift card. And I'm gonna pony it up. I really will. And... sucks for my aunt, 'cause she's not gonna have a birthday gift, but--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Bull! He said he was gonna eat what was inside the compost!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Weak!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir hands the compost bin over to Murph, who takes out a piece of moldy bread.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMURPH: [making airplane noises] Here comes the airplane!

Uuuuh, how 'bout this, I'll give you some tips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That'd be great.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Alright cool, one of the tips I'd say is maybe one of you guys is really obsessed with the other one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmir points knowingly at Jake<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Is he super into you all the time? Twenty-four-seven?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: I love that, I love that! And maybe it'd be like on of you guys is- just to keep with the theme- obsessed with a food product-<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR laughing: Okay<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Like chicken nuggets maybe?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Dude!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Are you into 'em?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR high fiving Ben: That's like (laughs) I eat that shit always!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: You know what else you should do? You should have a catch phrase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Ooh, I like that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: You need one a lot like '80s or '90s television, like Urkel, in Family Matters'd be like:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: \"Did I do that?\"<br />\r\n//<br />\r\nJAKE: \"And I did that!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN to Jake: No, you don't have to say it after me, and also you said it wrong. So, just for next time, it's: \"Did I do that?\"\t<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh I did that!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Stop. You don't have to repeat it after me, but just so you don't get embarrassed when you're in front of your friends, its- let's do it beat by beat: \"Did\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Did\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Alright, \"I\"-<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: -and I did that!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN looking puzzled: No... Alright... Or like a different catch-phrase, you know what's a great one? In Cheers, every time George Wendt came into the bar they'd scream: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN and AMIR: \"Norm!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Gnome!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Norm<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: DAN!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Stop. You can see my lips are saying \"Norm\"-<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: And I did that!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN pausing: Ok, it doesn't matter<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: You know what would help us with all of this?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: I have roommates back at home. Wanna go over there?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'd be down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Yeah.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah right, let me guess- the only way we can get back to your place is if you put your lips on my dick and blow me there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN looking shocked at Jake: ...nah. (To Amir) Do you want to head out?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmir and Ben leave the room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm- down to go too. I have to swing by anc get a new laptop at the muffin, but, then we go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJake, Amir and Ben are walking up to Ben's front door.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: I don't want to put my hand on your dick, Jake. You're gonna love these dudes, they're so cool.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What kind of animal do they drink like?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN shrugging: Skunks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmir pumps his fist<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Okay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey open the front door to Ben's house<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Ah, these, are my roommates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBen's house is populated by previous characters played by Ben Scwartz during the series, including the milkman<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMILKMAN: Milkman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey turn their heads towards a couch where more characters are seated, including the real estate agent from the 'Real Estate Agent' episodes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nREAL ESTATE AGENT: Eeehhhhh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJake is shaking his head as Amir gasps and turns towards him<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE muttering under his breath: Oh no...",

The doctor and the priest are sitting at the table, and Scalbylausus Jim the H.R. guy, Sulu Candles the usher, and Charles Crooshtoost the milkman are in the kitchen. Amir Blumenfeld the dating coach scoots by on an office chair.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[In the living room, the office painter, Cherry Dude the real estate agent, and the couples therapist are sitting on the couch.

Moo... moo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm not a fucking cow, man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: You mean \"Don't have a cow, man.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I think you actually think that I'm a cow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: This is exactly what a fucking cow would say, to try to weasel and snake his way out of a confrontation--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Okay, do you hear yourself?

You ever figure out who shit in that copier?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh, no.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Oh, yes. You've been a dick the entire day, Jake. Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No, no, I mean \"oh no, it's Carrot\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Carrot who?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's Carrot Slat!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: He tried to blow you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: He tr-- wha--? He did blow me!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Okay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That's enough. I want the language to change, right now, that he did...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: He is harmless, he is harmless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[As Jake and Ben argue, Carrot Slat is pulled back through the door. Stepping out in his place is the interrogator from Interrogator Part 2, who was apparently a different person the whole time.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTERROGATOR: I shit in the copier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No. No, no no no, no, no--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The interrogator punches Jake twice in the face and starts grabbing at Jake's belt.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Ow, oh! Oh-- g--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake shoves him off, and the interrogator waddles away, spinning.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Get out of here!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: [to the interrogator] You get that dirty fucking cow!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The interrogator comes back, fists raised, punches Jake again and goes for the belt.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: Grade A beef!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTERROGATOR: [suddenly stepping back] Get off of me!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't blow me, man!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Why would he blow you, Jake?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: He's done it before, okay? He really has.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Tried to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman! Looks like you got a shiner there. You want something cold to put on it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes, please.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Ah, well the name is Charles Crooshtoost, and I bring milk to man! What year could I get you, son?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Anything that's cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: In my hand right now, I've got a vintage September 1242.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No, that sounds like it's way too old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Well...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's antique milk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Who knows?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir shrugs.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's poison.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Where's the shiner?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's right here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yes, thank you, thank you--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST [pouring chunky milk all over Jake's head] Here we go, and now we're feeling good in the hood! We're feeling good in the hood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What the fuck are you--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: You're wasting all that cow juice!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Way to go, gotta go!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Why did you do that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOCTOR: Guys, I am a doctor. Everybody calm down. You shouldn't be pouring old milky cottage cheese on your face. Take the cold glass, and put it against your face!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, I know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You should have listened to the doctor, Jake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Don't.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSULU CANDLES: [singing and dancing] I hear we're writing a movie, I hear we're writing a movie! I hear we're writing a movie... but first, let's eat a snack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Sulu Candles throws a bag of candy at Jake, and it hits him in the face.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTANLEY: You could have caught it if you had fingers, cow!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: This is the worst day of my life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Ugh... what about the day you got your dick sucked?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...That was up there too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: The attempted dick-sucking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Attem-- it happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Get that through your head.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Geez, how many people live here? How'd you find this place?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Actually, Cherry Dude found it for us, and he moved in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHERRY DUDE: It was either this or a cupcake in La Cienega that'll drive ya wild!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'd be down to live in a cupcake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You already live in a muffin, [to Cherry Dude] thanks to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHERRY DUDE: Movin' on!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Everybody, listen up: Jake and Amir are here because they want to write a web series, and they need a little help with the first episode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJOPE: Ooh, I'll DJ the premiere party. What about this... [singing] Hey, yo, my name is Drake... do you know my buddy Samuel... he's got a Razor scooter... go, Samuel, you're doing it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: And I will bring the milk!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Nobody drinks milk at parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[As Charles Crooshtoost is talking, Sulu Candles tries to make Jake flinch with the bag of candy.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Okay, how old are the kids going to your parties? \"Nobody drinks milk at parties\"!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do you party with children?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Jake, why are you taking the wind out of everybody's sails? [to Amir] Is he always like this?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [gesturing to Charles Crooshtoost] He's a pedophile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: He's-- he's literally always negative to me, and he's always bringing me down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Oh my God. You know what? You have to start saying \"yes, and\" to things. That's how comedy works. You build upon things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The interrogator returns.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTERROGATOR: That's right, you piece of shit. So stop saying no and start saying yes! [lunges at Jake's pants]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Get out of here! Hey-- Ow! Get off of me, man!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTERROGATOR: Fine! It may be illegal now, but it won't be for long!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It's always gonna be against the law to do that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTERROGATOR: [leaving] Oh, we'll see. My dad's in the Senate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Alright, look, stop it. You guys can all help. Just one idea at a time, and no blowing me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Oh.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Or...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Or?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...everyone pitch their ideas at the same time and we get out of here fifty times quicker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: So smart. Let's do that. I'll get my laptop. Let's go over here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Not smart. It's actually a dumb idea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: [sitting down at his laptop] Everybody, on your marks, get set, go!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Fade up, on Charles Crooshtoost...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSULU CANDLES: Open on a movie theater...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHERRY DUDE: ...in Wilshire. There he is...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJOPE: ...What are they doing? They're trying to...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: [singing] ...Hail to the milkman, the milkman, the milkman! Hail to the milkman, the milkman is me!...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: ...never been stretched before. What are these called?

Jake has toweled the milk off his face.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Done! ...Perfect, we did it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: No it's not. I didn't get a word in edgewise, guys. How many pages is this thing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Yeah-- it is... four hundred and two pages, but, to be fair, it is double-sided.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: That is 804, then.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Yeah, but you know what? I just double-checked it: it's way over a thousand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's okay. It's better to have over a thousand pages of garbage than four pages of gold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Yeah.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Completely disagree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBEN: Hey, what do you guys say about a wrap party, huh?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix \"The Milkman\" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [as Ben and Amir dance] How is this possible?

Why are you wearing that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [jutting his golf bag out] Golf clubs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do you think I said \"What are you wearing\"? I said \"Why\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm trying to be relatable, dimwit. You know, this is actually a pretty big problem you have: You often reject my shit at the face without really trying to understand and grasp the subtle nuance behind it. Zoom out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: We're meeting with high-power producers, trying to get them to give us money to fund the insane script that you wrote. The least you can do is act like a professional.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [imitating Christian Bale] Are you professional?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Stop with the Christian Bale shit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Sorry!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It happened--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I just learned about it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The two producers, later referred to as Lyle and Blanche, show up.

I'm bored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: So am I. Blanche, Lyle, I apologize for my... insanely boring colleague. He doesn't realize that from him, even a little bit is too much.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBLANCHE: Agreed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: But pass me the conch.

Your friend is tedious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Enough, Lyle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: My father was a quiet man. Proud. Growing up, we moved... a lot.

Chinese fire drill!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir, Lyle and Blanche all get up and begin running around the table and laughing.

I'm sorry, but we reject your offer. It's not only a drop in the bucket, but it's a slap in the face. Lyle, you've underplayed your hand!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLYLE: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you knew how to play hardball. Can't blame an old exec for trying!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: But you can teach one new tricks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Lyle and Blanche laugh at length.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: It wasn't that good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBLANCHE: A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, cash in hand.

Count this cash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake opens up the bag. It is full of bills.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Though I'll tell you right now we're not accepting it, because we want complete creative control, Lyle!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir lights a match and throws it into the bag. Jake puts it out with a wad of bills.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: We want full fucking autonomy, Blanche.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir throws another match, which Jake puts out.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Stop doing that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLYLE: That's absurd. There has to be some oversight!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: The only oversight here is you, Lyle. As in: I'm over the sight... of your jowly face. [to Blanche] Of your... old pussy. I bid you guys namaste, I bid you guys adieu, I bid you all arrive-door-cheese. Jake, hand them the blood money back, please.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLYLE: Keep it. Good luck, Amir.

And I said as soon as you see what-- what I saw in this guy that I had known for my entire life, Mickey, I just-- I had no idea, Mickey! It was beautiful to see, Mickey, this transformation! When did you vacation in a cocoon and emerge as a beautiful butterfly, Mickey? Go to deadline.com, Mickey. Go to deadline.com right now, Mickey. It's a Hollywood-style gossip blogzine, Mickey, and you, my friend, are on the front page.

How's that sound?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: We have a feast, okay? You're ruining it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: No, no, no, no no no. It's not a date until I make my famous crepes! [stands up awkwardly]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I thought you said it wasn't a date. You said we were on a not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: BRC, alright? Be right... crepe. [leaves for the kitchen]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I'm really sorry. I don't know that guy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMARISA: Mm-hmm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Cliff Bleszinski joins them. Jake throws up his hands in defeat.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLIFF: I couldn't help but notice how badly this is going. I'm Cliff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMARISA: I know who you are! I'm Marisa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLIFF: And I know who you are.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Marisa laughs.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [laughing sarcastically] Hey Cliff, man, look: We all love Games of Worms. Alright, we all do. But honestly, I'm on a date right here, so. Bro code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLIFF: Bro code?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah. Bro code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMARISA: ...So, Gears 3, huh? I'm unbelievably pumped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLIFF: You should be excited. It's gonna be big.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: [mocking] \"It's gonna be big!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [returning from the kitchen] Hey bro, do you know where the rice pots are?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: I thought you were making crepes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Yeah, I am. Amir style. That's with a whole lot of rice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You don't need any rice. And that's not my kitchen, by the way, so I wouldn't know where the rice pot is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Okay, well the chef is being super uncooperative, man!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Brief flashback to Amir kicking the chef in the gut.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: That's right... I'll teach you... for being a chef!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Either way, now I can't find jack squat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Then don't make it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Just go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir leaves, headed for the kitchen again.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLIFF: So, uh, I got some food back at my house. You want to go back, uh, maybe get some dinner, have a sneak peek at the game?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, thanks, dude, but she's not hungry--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMARISA: Yes, I do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Cliff and Marisa leave arm in arm.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Take a hint, man... alright...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir is back in the kitchen, holding two raw Cornish hens.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Guys, screw it. I'm making you Cornish hens instead. That's right, an after-dinner bird, and it's gonna be delicious. [putting the birds directly on the stove element] Here we go, all right, one time! Hey Cliff, how's that sound, man? Ever had a frickin' turkey for dessert before? [laughs] Okay, which one of these is fire? [fumbling with the knobs]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The screen reads \"GEARS OF WAR 3\"; \"SEPTEMBER 20\"; \"WORLDWIDE\".]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake and Amir are sitting at the table. Amir raises his hand for a high five.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Not gonna high five you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Alright. I wouldn't, just 'cause I've been touching raw meat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The video closes off with the Xbox and Microsoft logos.]",

Amir has a megaphone.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [patting Jake on the knee] Good shoot, as they say! Good shoot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Can you please not? Alright? That was an absolutely harrowing experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Nobody said making art would be easy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You cut off your own dick today, man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [through the megaphone] Excuse...?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You stepped out of your trailer in front of a huge plume of crystal meth smoke. You strode onto the set, put your penis through the slate, and said \"'The Entire Crew Screams and Calls 911', take two,\" and slammed the device on your shaft. Your genitals hit the floor with a sickening slap, and everyone stood in stunned silence for an eternity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir accidentally sets off the megaphone's siren, but turns it off. Jake snatches it away from him.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Oh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You never stopped smiling through the whole entire thing, even as you bled out through the stump on your mound, even as the paramedics arrived, and failed to reattach your reproductive organ. You kept yelling, \"I'll be a better director as a eunuch! My libido won't guide my eye!\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir gestures along as Jake quotes him, raising his arms for emphasis and then pointing at his eye.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm sorry if I went dickless for Michael Chiklis. I'm serious. [air quotes] I apologize if I \"inconvenienced anybody\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You inconvenienced everybody. Eventually, you convinced the paramedics to attach your big toe to your pelvic bone to use as your phallus. You said \"as long as it's chubby, a girl will rubby\". I will never forget that weird rhyme as long as I live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Huh... Thank you--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Not a compliment. You also rented an IMAX camera, for no reason. That's a hundred thousand dollars, for the day, out of our budget, and you didn't even shoot anything interesting! You laid it on the ground, and paraded a bunch of construction paper dinosaurs around in front of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [holding a paper pterodactyl out in front of him] Welcome, to Jurassic Shart?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: So dumb. Don't--<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir grunts and squirms for a long time, and shits without farting. He throws the pterodactyl down in frustration.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Great. You shit your pants without farting. So it's not even a shart; it's just a shit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [frustrated] Anal!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What are you gonna do without a penis?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Let me ask: Why are you so fixated on that small part of the day?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Fixated on that\"... it's a small part of you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: A lot of other stuff happened, by the way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You know what? I'm fixated because you castrated yourself publicly!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [sarcastically] Oooooh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah! Yeah, you ruined today! We didn't get any good footage!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It's there in pieces!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Your penis is in pieces!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Excuse you! Absolutely excuse you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Excuse you. You monster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: By the way, whatever we didn't get today, we pick up tomorrow! That's why it's called a pick-up!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: What money do we shoot the pick-ups with? You blew the entire budget! A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars gone, spent on an IMAX camera and a lunch comprised entirely of bird's nest soup! It's a Chinese delicacy. It cost forty-five hundred dollars a bowl, which of course meant we didn't even get to feed the entire crew of fifty people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: [holding up a finger to stop Jake] I had a KIND bar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh good! Good, so you ate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I had a KIND bar--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: You also had soup!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: --and soup! I had a KIND bar and soup, which I think is f--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: How is that fair? Other people didn't eat anything at all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Let's talk post-production for a second.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Insane.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I'm thinking in terms of editing, I can cut the bitch up myself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do you know how to--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: I mean, I do have iMovie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Do you know how to edit?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: You know what? Suck my fuckin' toe, dude!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Good, good reaction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir unzips his pants and whips out his relocated big toe.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: Suck my toe!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Oh!

Let the feeling of failure wash over you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir makes a defensive face to dismiss Jake.

[picking up the original script, tossing a copy to Amir] Look at this thing! It was so easy to produce, we could have shot it ourselves on one of these.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake holds up a small digital camera.

What's your first line?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir clears his throat, holds the camera at arm's length to his side, and begins recording. The video they record is the 2007 Jake and Amir episode \"Beer\". During their read we see glimpses of Amir's recorded footage, which is that of the original episode.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"So drunk...\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Uh-- \"You're drunk right now?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"Last night, I got so drunk...\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Um... you-- ...nice.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"I had, like, so many beers.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"How many? How many is so many?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"I was, like, retarded.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"How many beers did you have?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR \"...Sixty.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Sixty? That's... sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"I know... how many is believable?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"Twelve?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: \"I know. Twelve. I had twelve beers. I was... stupid afterwards.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: \"I don't think you even know-- I don't think you've had any beer, ever.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir pauses, losing motivation to continue reading.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...Actually, this is pretty bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: It was funny when we wrote it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: Yeah, I guess so...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[They both put their copies of the script in their boxes. Amir sighs.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJAKE: ...So what's next?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Amir pauses for a long time as he tries to think of an answer.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAMIR: ...Dinner tonight?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Jake quietly contemplates Amir's offer, and takes a last look around the offices of CollegeHumor. The screen cuts to black.]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[A credits sequence for the series plays, set to My Chemical Romance's \"Black Parade\" (in the CollegeHumor upload, an instrumental song is used).
